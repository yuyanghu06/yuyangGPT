Goes after several journalists who criticized him. A twitter thread of the Nov 2019 swatting police report, and those targeted by Musk.\n\nIn another PR stunt in April 2020, after dismissing covid fears as \"dumb\", he states that he will send 1k ventilators to the New York City hospital system. He ends up sending 40 out-of-spec ones, that doctors warn could spread the virus further. He also claims that SpaceX is working on ventilators. After faltering first quarter 2020 Telsa sales, he goes on a twitter rant to \"FREE AMERICA NOW\", and demands that the lockdown be ended at its height in April 2020.\n\nAfter the US-backed overthrow of Bolivia's president Evo Morales (mainly for control of its lithium resources), the unelected interim opposition leader Jean Anez privatises Bolivia's state lithium company, and invites Elon Musk to produce batteries there. He concurs, and Tesla's stock price soars. In response Elon Musk says: \"We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it.\"\n\nFired his assistant of 12 years for asking for a raise.\n\nDivorced his wife after telling her that his life \"operated quite smoothly\" in her absence.\n\nWas a friend of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIf you need sources on any of these please let me know.", "Attachments": ""},

Is it any surprise that a union-busting capitalist donated heavily to the Republican Party? Musk takes advantage of international crises to raise Tesla's stock price. In one case, Musk promised to \"fix\" Puerto Rico's power grid after it was decimated by Hurricane Maria. He deploys solar panels to a hospital, dozens of news articles were written about the business-saviness of this decision, and the stock price soared. PR reps told Musk they don't want their power grid privatized by billionaries.\n\nAs a PR stunt, Musk promised to build a mini-submarine to rescue a boys soccer team that got trapped in a Thai cave in 2018. After receiving vitriol from the Thai and rescue community, Musk called one of the cave rescuers, a pedophile,2. After the rescuer sues Musk for defamation, Musk pays 50k to a private investigator (and former felon), to dig up dirt on the rescuer., and was told to use \"aggressive tactics\". Musk's team then told the investigator: “We would like you to immediately move forward with ‘leaking’ this information to the UK press. Obviously must be done very carefully.” Musk and his team even lobbied the Thai gov and prime minister to get a local official to reverse a statement saying the mini-submarine wasn't practical, before the children had been rescued.", "Attachments": ""},

Well….\n\nIn typical authleft fashion… here we go\n\nCrushes unionization attempts at tesla factories, promising free frozen yogurt in return.\n\nEmployees at Tesla suffer twice as many serious workplace injuries than the industry average.\n\nForced to pay out ~$4 Million in a class action lawsuit to 4,100 SpaceX employees who say the company refused to allow them to take legally mandated breaks during the workday, as a consequence of how the company structured its shift patterns.\n\nUses public money to fund private ventures, costing taxpayers $4.9B.\n\nAttracts new investors by hyping failed projects, leading many financial investigators to consider Tesla a ponzi scheme.\n\nMusk fires Tesla worker for testing positive for THC, then goes on the Joe Rogan show and smokes weed himself. In reality the worker was fired for her union organizing and supporting the United Autoworkers Union.\n\nWants to privatize space travel, leaving colonization and exploration to to the richest few.\n\nActively feeds his own cult of personality, as it raises his company's stock price. Criticism of Musk or Tesla is often met with toxic harrassment, especially against women.\n\nReddit: Why is there such a big cult of personality around Musk? One such \"Tony-Stark\" from Rolling-Stone.\n\nDespite rumours of Musk being a self-made mad scientist genius, he was born into a wealthy white South African family, and his father owns Emerald mines. His wealth comes not from scientific discovery or innovation, but from his father funding his first business ventures, and from buying and selling companies such as PayPal, Zip2, SolarCity, SpaceX, and Tesla.", "Attachments": ""},
