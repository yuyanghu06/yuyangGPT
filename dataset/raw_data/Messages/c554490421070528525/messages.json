It's a tiny channel, with only 30-40 viewers per podcast, since we've only just done our first. We're just starting out, and I want to get your views on a few things that we might talk about. My friend and I are just 12, but we talk about science, technology, politics, religion, etc. We do one every Saturday at 9 PM Pacific time. if you want to come on, tell me, and we'll schedule a time.", "Attachments": ""}
