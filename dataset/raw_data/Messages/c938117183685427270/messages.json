What is the geographical explanation for those several battles? - Geographically speaking, the two major battles on the Eastern front at Tannenberg and Masurian lakes were fought where they were as they represented the prewar boundary between the Russian and German Empires. When Russia was defeated there, they were forced to go on the defensive and never be able to launch any real offensives into the Central Powers. The defeats at the border would solidify the course of the war for the Russian Empire, and it’s the battle site’s proximity to the German border that would explain their importance. In the south, the battle of Gallipoli, an offensive launched by the Commonwealth to try and force the Ottoman Empire to make peace, was important both politically and geographically because of their proximity to the Ottoman homeland of Anatolia. The offensive, brainchild of future British Prime Minister Winston Churchill failed both due to poor planning by the Entente, (lack of naval support, overconfidence in their own forces, etc.). Geographically, the site was likely chosen due to it’s proximity to the Ottoman capital of Constantinople. If the Commonwealth forces landing had been successful in their initial push into Anatolia, they would be able to march on the Turkish capital and force them to make peace with the Entente, thus ending another front and making a victory for the Entente more likely.", "Attachments": ""},

What were some of the underlying causes for the Great War that broke out in 1914? - The Great War was, at the time, the deadliest conflict that Europe had ever gone through. While most know of the immediate causes behind it, beginning with the assasination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, not many take into account that the war was the result of decades of political tension coming to a boil, and not simply one side of the other being extremely bloodthirsty for conflict. In order to begin, we first must look at the state of Europe at the time. Most of the great powers of Europe had vast empires that could surpass all those in history, however, not everyone was content with the amount of territory they had. Notably, Germany and Austria - Hungary. Germany, despite being a leading player in the decision to carve up Africa had gained virtually miniscule amounts of territory on the continent when compared to the other powers in Europe. Their ambitions for a vast, nearly continent spanning colony (Mittelafrika) or a continental economic union spanning from Ukraine to the Baltics and from Poland to Belgium (Mitteleuropa) were far from fulfilled, as such, they saw a conflict, any conflict with the west as being their chance to gain this empire. Austria, on the other hand, had long desired to subjugate the Balkans. They saw the region as being a hotbed for conflict, as well as being room to expand. When a Serbian terrorist assasinated the heir to the Austrian throne, they saw it as being a perfect opportunity to establish their sphere of influence over the newly independent states in the area. This, when combined with the web of alliances sown all over the continent are all some of the reasons that war broke out in 1914.", "Attachments": ""},
