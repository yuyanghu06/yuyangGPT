{"text": "On the 30th of January, 1933, democracy died. On this day,     Adolf Hitler, leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nazi Party) was pronounced Chancellor of Germany after his party had decisively defeated their opponents in the elections of the previous year, and from this point on, up until the capitulation of Germany to the Allied powers in the Second World War, Germany would essentially be ruled as a one party state. Over the course of the following year, the Nazis would go on to purge all opponents to their rule in Germany, and in the ensuing decade, unleash the most destructive war in human civilization upon the rest of the world. But just how had Germany gotten to this point? The answer lies in a single word: division, because, in many ways, the very political polarization covered by Kurt Gray in modern America was not only present in 1920s Germany, but dominated it. After the end of the First World War, Germany had been racked by economic and political hardships. Revolutions, counterrevolutions, hyperinflation, and unemployment had been the norm for over a decade in a country that had, at the turn of the 20th century, been widely regarded as Europe’s greatest power. Germans were angry, and extremist groups in Germany used this anger as fuel for their own political machines. They dehumanized the enemies of their supporters (political opposition groups, minorities, etc.), played upon their fears (loss of rights, national enemies), and their moralities (degradation of family life, class inequality), and were able to grow from the fringes of society to dominating mainstream politics, culminating in Hitler’s rise in 1933 and the tumultuous decade that followed it."}
{"text": "Just fifteen years after his rise, Hitler would be dead, and Germany in ruins. The Second World War had seen tens of millions of Europeans die and entire cities flattened for what ended up being a futile attempt at domination by the Nazis. Yet, in this ruin, something strange happened. After seeing firsthand what radicalization and extremism had brought themselves, Germans began to drift away from politics. They started seeing their fellow Germans, and indeed their fellow Europeans, not as enemies, inferiors, or traitors, but as people. They knew that to build a better tomorrow, they needed to work together, for the betterment of not only themselves, but those around them. Institutions like the European Union, NATO, or the Eurozone all owe their roots to the foundations laid by these concepts, and without it, Germany and the rest of Europe would look very different, and without a doubt far worse, today. Political polarization is a disease, and much like in 20th century Germany, until we rid ourselves of this disease, and see those that we disagree with as being equal to ourselves, we only risk further violence, destruction, and the end of our way of life as we know it."}

{"text": "With climate change becoming more of a threat everyday, the transition to clean energy has come to the forefront of discussion regarding climate change. The path to a sustainable future is clear, but it requires concentrated effort, bold actions, and global cooperation. Today, I want to give you all a general roadmap for facilitating the energy transition, a roadmap that not only promises a brighter, greener future but also ensures economic prosperity and social equity for generations to come."}
{"text": "First and foremost, we must acknowledge the strides we have made. Recent government actions have laid the foundation for the transition to clean energy. In particular, initiatives like the Biden Administration's Inflation Reduction Act have incentivized the adoption of solar energy by providing tax credits for households installing solar panels. These measures are vital steps towards reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating the impacts of climate change."}
{"text": "However, the reality is that much of the world still relies heavily on fossil fuels for energy, with coal being a predominant source. Shockingly, 61% of China's and 74% of India's energy supplies are derived from coal. This stark reality underscores the urgency of global cooperation in facilitating the transition to clean energy. We cannot achieve sustainability in isolation; it requires a collaborative effort with both developed and developing nations."}
{"text": "To accelerate this transition, we must prioritize investment in renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. These technologies hold immense potential to reshape our energy landscape and reduce our carbon footprint. Additionally, we must reconsider our stance on nuclear power. Despite past incidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima, nuclear plants, when properly maintained, are remarkably safe and efficient. Reopening nuclear power plants can play a pivotal role in replacing existing coal and natural gas plants, thereby further reducing our reliance on fossil fuels."}
{"text": "Furthermore, we must provide incentives for companies to innovate and develop clean energy solutions. Tax breaks for clean energy initiatives and electric vehicle manufacturers will spur innovation and drive the widespread adoption of sustainable technologies."}
{"text": "In conclusion, facilitating the energy transition requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses policy reforms, international collaboration, technological innovation, and public support. By embracing these principles and working together, we can usher in a new era of clean, renewable energy that sustains both our planet and future generations."}

While initially a fair yet ruthless ruler, the weight of ruling a realm as vast as his causes him to slowly lose his sanity and turn to tyranny. When a minor rebellion breaks out on a frontier planet, his unhinged and extreme methods to crush it lead to a massive rebellion across his empire.

{"text": "Chapter 1: A gravitational anomaly has shown up outside the Caelum system. Mark Coughlin, veteran pilot of the war of independence, is sent to investigate."}
{"text": "It started with a blip. It had first appeared towards the end of a standard Caleum day during a routine recon patrol of the region outside the gravity well of the gas giant Orbon. The team that had picked it up had initially dismissed it as a radar malfunction, as their decades old systems were known to do, and hadn’t even bothered to report it when returning to base."}
{"text": "Yet the next morning, a forward reconnaissance post near Orbon also picked it up. Debates quickly sparked over what it could be, but eventually, detailed scans showed that it was a gravitational anomaly, akin to the miniscule traces left behind by warp drives when traversing to different systems, only this was larger, multiple orders of magnitudes larger."}
{"text": "The first probes sent to the region all vanished, their systems malfunctioning before they completely vanished from radar scans. Some initially theorized they were being jammed, while others despairingly believed they were being shot down."}
{"text": "On the third day, down on Caelum a council meeting was called, notably however, without the presence of the Count. The council had agreed that this was a delicate and potentially trivial matter, and not something to disturb the young Lord with, given his preoccupation with negotiations with the King on Agrius."}
{"text": "It was during this meeting that the decision was taken to send in a ship to the region. Machines were far too prone to error, and it was believed that a skilled pilot would be more capable of gauging the reality of the situation, while potentially also defusing tensions if, as some feared, this was the beginning of an attack by the King."}
{"text": "And so Mark Williams was called in from retirement. A legendary pilot renowned for his contributions to the defense of Caelum during the war of independence nearly fifty years earlier, it was agreed by members of the naval establishment that he would be the best choice to lead the mission. Before he even agreed to the task, a ship had already been prepared, and a crew was already assembled."}
{"text": "Less than a day after being given the details of his assignment, Mark stood in a hangar on a station orbiting Orbon, staring towards the region of space he would soon be barreling towards."}
{"text": "Behind him was his ship. An old interceptor from the Independence War, it was all that the navy could spare given most of the fleet was mobilized and stationed in orbit around Caelum itself. But the age of the vessel gave Mark no trouble. It was old, and a veteran, much like him. The design was familiar to his aged hands, as he had flown this very model during his famous twenty two hour flight in the Battle of Kingfall (or Arthurstown as it was called at the time), giving him a sense of ease. If he was going to be potentially sailing to his demise, he preferred that it was in a craft he knew inside and out."}
{"text": "As Mark peered behind him, at the flight crew doing last minute preparations before takeoff, and at his two co - pilots, eagerly discussing flight and boarding tactics, he felt a wave of sadness wash over him."}
{"text": "“They’re all so young!” he noted to himself. From had noticed each and every man on board the station hardly looked past twenty, just barely past"}
{"text": "He was finally all packed, and ready to leave. As he took one last look at the house he had grown up in, the house his family had lived in for generations, he couldn’t help but shed a tear at having to finally leave it behind. But what choice did he have?"}
{"text": "They were being kicked out. The communists had won, and anyone who had even a tiny bit of money was having their lands collectivized for the state to redistribute."}
{"text": "It seemed unfair. His brother had fought for them during the war, and now they paid them back like this? No aid, no assistance, just a letter in the mail, a soldier at the door, an eviction notice and an atmosphere of hopelessness."}
{"text": "And where were they to go? The countryside was hopeless. 30 years of near constant warfare, of torching crops and burying textbooks to avoid being pillaged, tends to have that effect on a land."}
{"text": "His only choice was the city, and that was where he planned to set off for. He was young, and he hoped the education from his relatively wealthy upbringing would land him a spot in a university, and give him the opportunity to rebuild his life from scratch."}
{"text": "As he turned to give his dying village one last glance, he saw nothing but death and desperation. So instead, he turned away. The journey of a thousand miles begins with just one step, so he took his first step away from home, away from destitution, and to a new life."}
{"text": "After arriving in Beijing, my grandfather went on to study architecture in university, and work as an architect designing the bases of buildings for the next forty years. He eventually got his freedom, and his story continues to inspire me to this day."}
{"text": "As he closed the lid on the last of his unpacked suitcases, Cheng stopped for a moment to take in the sight around him. This room, this house, this village - these had been all he had known for the eighteen short years of his life thus far. The dark emptiness of it all seemed odd to him now; for so long, this small corner of the world had been the only constant in his life, the one place that was truly his. As he tore it all down, it was as if he was destroying that constance as well."}
{"text": "He glanced at his now empty bedframe, vaguely making out the rectangular outline of the wooden Kang. Memories from his earliest years came back to him, of fearful nights spent huddled up with his mother listening to the sounds of far off explosions, machine gun fire, and the endless shouting that accompanied it all. Those days were long gone now, with their noises having been washed away by the sounds of party cadres rallying villagers into chants praising the virtues of the new Socialist era that had arrived."}
{"text": "He drifted towards the mottled, gray window in the corner, observing the faint streaks of sunlight that managed its way through. Glancing outside into the courtyard, he began to recall the sight of his father, seated at a hastily assembled tea table with Japanese soldiers from the nearby garrison, desperately pleading with them to take even more of the village’s already meager harvest, hoping to save them from the infamous reprisal attacks ravaging the southern cities. Although he had been too young to fully grasp the situation, even then, something within Cheng had recoiled at the sight of the foreign strangers."}
{"text": "It was those same stirrings, perhaps, that had compelled his brother to join up with the Communists. He could still remember how his family had stood gathered around that same courtyard entrance, waving teary eyed goodbyes as the eldest son left behind his world to fight for the future Mao’s forces offered. How ironic it was, that it was those same soldiers, that same promised future, that was now forcing his family from their home."}
{"text": "Stepping away from the window and pulling himself back to the present, the familiar sound of tense, hushed arguing once again filled the room. His brother and mother had rekindled the same, circular conversation that had consumed the household in the weeks since the soldiers had first handed them their eviction notice: what were they to do now?"}
{"text": "They had long been the richest family in the village, their influence so great that the entire region relied on them to handle local affairs. Yet their comparatively benign reputation, along with a record of family service “to the revolution,” allowed them to escape the worst excesses of the early collectivization years. That luck had now run out."}
{"text": "For months now, rumors of a new campaign launched by the party leadership in Beijing had been reaching them. Posters advertising a “Great Leap Forward” had begun to dot the walls of homes everywhere from here to Baoding. Cheng remembered how, while sitting on the back of a horse - drawn cart on his way into the city to take his university entrance exams, he had been so bored that he had begun to start to count them; within just a few short kilometers, he had lost track entirely."}
{"text": "It was a week after the exam results had arrived, in the fading heat of late summer, that the soldiers had first appeared. With their father gone, his brother had assumed the role of head of the household; upon hearing news of their arrival, he had rushed to don his old wartime uniform, before coming out to receive them. The two men were young, crinkled, freshly issued uniforms still stiff at the seams. When they spoke, a foul odor drifted into the air, revealing mouths full of dirty, uneven teeth."}
{"text": "Yet it was the words spilling from those mouths that cut deepest. No amount of pleading, of appeals to his wartime track record, or of camaraderie and joint loyalty to the revolution would spare them from their accusations of the family as “landlords”, “being bourgeois\", and being labeled as “oppressors” and “enemies of the new Socialist order”. The two men, eyes flaming with the passion of youth and devotion to their cause, had spat out their orders with contempt, giving the family mere weeks to abandon the home their ancestors had built and lived in for generations, before turning on their heels and disappearing without so much as a backward glance."}
{"text": "The weeks since had been merciless. A suffocating desperation crept through every room, clinging to each member of the household with the same stubbornness as the grime that coated the walls. For Cheng, the only thread that kept him clinging to this new reality was the prospect of being able to soon escape from his family’s situation, to claim the place his university acceptance letter had offered in the city, and hopefully build a new life and future far away from the hopelessness of the village."}
{"text": "The rest of the family, too, found themselves clutching at that same slender thread. Since the notice had come, his mother had been furiously micromanaging Cheng’s luggage - nitpicking every outfit choice and questioning every piece of memorabilia he put away. His brother, meanwhile, had spent several nights speaking with Cheng in hushed tones, drawing from his own experiences with the Party, determined to ensure Cheng would know how to compose himself in the unfamiliar world that awaited him."}
{"text": "“The world has changed”, his brother repeated again and again, each time with a little more urgency “and you must change with it”."}
{"text": "And so, as stood at the doorframe, staring at neatly packed suitcases and the hollow stillness of the room around them, Cheng once again wondered what awaited him beyond this threshold - and whether he would ever have a home to return to. All his life, he had departed the village at the start of each term, forced each time to reshape himself in a world of unfamiliarity. He knew this time was different, however. A new flag, a new government, and a new society had befallen his country, and now he could not even rely on there being some corner of the world he could safely call his own to comfort him."}
{"text": "A gentle tapping echoed behind him: the unmistakable, measured steps of his mother’s bound feet. He turned as she appeared in the doorway to greet her, masking his grief behind an air of pride."}
{"text": "Taking one final glance around him, at the four walls which had shaped who he was, and which had once held a future that seemed so sure to him. Cheng summoned every ounce of resolve he could find, and nodded."}
{"text": "His heart hammered with anticipation as Ming flew down the newly paved road on his bicycle, swerving around the freshly imported buses and cars that clogged the street and shouting hurried apologies at the passerbys he narrowly avoided. At last, he skidded into the courtyard that marked the entrance to his apartment complex. Shoving his beloved, and only, means of transportation up against the wall, he thundered up the stairs two at a time before bursting into his family’s unit."}
{"text": "The home was small, but more than enough in the eyes of the four residents that it housed. Ming’s eyes darted around the living room, locking eyes with his bewildered mother sitting on the wooden sofa, who had herself only just arrived home from her lab."}
{"text": "It was true. Ordinarily, Ming would stay out long after his classes had ended, playing basketball with his classmates, tinkering around in the school’s small computer lab, or just partaking in any activity he could find that wasn’t at home. But today was different."}
{"text": "Gaokao results had arrived the night before. For weeks - ever since the exams were collected and the ink on their answers had barely dried - students had lived in a state of angst. Classrooms, normally filled with life, lay dead with the silence of anticipation. The field, ordinarily filled with students out enjoying the little sunlight that the polluted skies of Beijing could offer, lay empty. Everyone knew that at any moment, the teachers would call them together, distribute the results, and in doing so, set the course of hundreds of futures. Ming’s class hung on the brink; the lives of his classmates were about to tilt toward triumph or collapse with the opening of a single envelope."}
{"text": "It was early in the afternoon when the call finally rang out. Towards the end of the school day, just as lectures were winding down and homework assignments were being dished out, the school’s newly installed intercom system crackled to life - first with a burst of static, and then a voice that the sounds of hundreds."}
{"text": "It repeated once, though it hardly needed to. Before the announcement had even finished echoing, hundreds of chairs were being scraped against the floor, and a tidal wave of footsteps thundered towards their respective classroom exits, drowning out the noises of anxious teachers desperately trying to keep order."}
{"text": "The next hour went by in a blur for Ming. One moment, he had been slumped over his desk in his advanced mathematics course, on the verge of falling asleep to the sound of his teacher's monotone voice, and the next, he was standing in front of the entire student population, legs on the verge of giving out as he walked up to the headmaster’s podium to collect the envelope which would change his life, no matter its contents. Before he had even returned to his spot on the poorly maintained field they were gathered in, Ming had torn it open, eyes locking onto the lines of text within, and the all important number that accompanied them."}
{"text": "And it was this that had led him to begin his long odyssey home on the back of his beloved bicycle, nearly losing the future the results had promised him more than once as he came close to colliding with passing buses, automobiles, and unsuspecting pedestrians."}
{"text": "Now, as he stood in the living room with his mother, analyzing her every move as she took the paper from his hands, he watched as the same spark which had driven these last few hours lit up in her eyes. She would know how much a result like this meant for the course of her son’s future. She had experienced it herself, nearly forty years earlier when such a slip of paper had lifted her away from a family freshly recovering from their flight across a country at war with itself, into one of the nation’s most prestigious universities, ultimately propelling her into the comfortable, middle class existence she had today."}
{"text": "Hours later, Ming’s father, Cheng, returned home to a household already ablaze with excitement. Confusion flickered across his face for only a moment before it, too, was consumed by the flame set alight by the now - crinkled paper placed in his hands."}
{"text": "“Tonight, we celebrate!” he declared, and celebrate they did."}
{"text": "In the late hours of the evening, as his children retired to their rooms, exhausted by the events of the day, and his wife busied herself in the kitchen cleaning up the banquet of dishes the family had gone through, Cheng settled into an armchair in the living room, a bottle of Coca - Cola - the exotic taste of which he had developed a liking to in the short time since it had arrived in the country - in hand, and began partaking in a newly developed evening habit of his: watching the news."}
{"text": "In many ways, the family’s small television had quickly become their most treasured possession. Few households in their neighborhood owned one, and its presence conferred a quiet prestige. Neighbors would frequently appear at their door under flimsy pretexts, only to end up gathered around the peculiar metal box, marveling at the moving images it produced.Though no one in the household would ever openly acknowledge it, there was a certain pleasure in being envied - in owning something rare, something that set them apart from everyone else."}
{"text": "Yet despite the pleasure he usually took in watching the bright lights dance across its screen, tonight Cheng’s attention was anywhere but on the television that had so often been a source of joy for him. Its mere presence, once promising, now only distracted him. Today marked a new chapter in the story of his family. For so long, he had been its sole author, tightly gripping the pen with anxious determination, terrified that somewhere along the line the tip would snap, the ink would smear, and he would be forced to begin again - returned to the bleak uncertainty of childhood: alone in a strange city, homeless in all but name, guided only by a fragile dream and the stubborn hope that it would one day lead somewhere better."}
{"text": "And yet today, his son had proved to him that it was not all for naught. Today, Ming had sat down his freshly imported ballpoint pen, and began to write with a vigor he could not hope to match. For so long he had lived under the hope that tomorrow would be better, and that tomorrow was finally materializing. While it was hard for him to picture what the next ten, twenty, or thirty years might look like for the household, he knew that under Ming’s stewardship, it would ultimately lead to something great, into new heights unfathomable to him in the present."}
{"text": "And so, as he sat there in his armchair, sipping at the foreign beverage and staring blankly at the lightbox in front of him, Cheng felt at ease, and truly at home, for the first time in a long time. Tomorrow was going to be different, better, brighter. All he had to do was let it arrive."}
{"text": "The smog wasn’t as bad as it usually was today. From where he stood, here in the north side of the Olympic Park, Ming could actually see the Olympic Towers roughly a mile and a half south of him, jutting out into the sky and dominating the apartment block filled skyline. He still remembered the first time he had visited this side of Beijing, less than ten years earlier, back when the area had been filled predominantly by farms, fields, and closed off construction sites. His friends had called him crazy for wanting to purchase a unit in such an underdeveloped region, but he had insisted, and he was right to. The investment brought about by the games some two years earlier had driven up property values in the area massively, and those same friends were now regretting not getting in when he had told them to."}
{"text": "Turning his thoughts and gaze back to more earthly matters, Ming watched as his son, Yang, dressed as a walking promo for Mickey Mouse, rode around on his little bicycle, training wheels and all, untroubled both by the burdens of the world and the passerbys diverting their paths to avoid him. Perhaps we should move, he thought to himself, but decided against it. The sun was setting, and without its light the chill of winter would begin to worsen, and they would have to leave soon anyways. He would let Yang enjoy, for a few more minutes, the innocent memory of an afternoon outing between father and son at this park which had so quickly become a family staple, in a part of the world they would rarely see again in the coming years."}
{"text": "Was he making the correct decision by choosing to leave it all behind? He of course knew the tangible benefits the move would bring: better pay, bigger houses, more opportunities, and the chance to live the life he had grown up seeing in the movies and reading about in the books. But at what cost? He and his wife had both grown up less than ten miles from where they now stood, and had never known a life that wasn’t here in Beijing. Would they even be able to adjust? Start anew at thirty five, in a country, culture, and language that they had only ever learned about in the classroom or the theater, live an ocean apart from the families they had scarcely ever been more than a ten minute drive from, would they ever find another Olympic Park? Would a memory like the one from this afternoon even be possible in California, and if so, when? The coming years would be hard, and he had no idea how a child of five like Yang would even be able to adjust to such a radical change."}
{"text": "But he knew he had to. His own father, Cheng, had known how difficult it was to leave behind everything he knew in pursuit of a better life, and had chosen to do so anyway. And look at where that had gotten them. Perhaps, in another thirty, twenty, or even ten years Yang would look back himself, from a skyscraper in the glittering Manhattan skyline or on a sunkissed Southern Californian beach and be grateful Ming had chosen the harder path forward as well. But what if he wouldn’t?"}
{"text": "He knew exactly why these questions gnawed at him. What if he failed? For so long, this hadn’t merely been an ambition - it had been the ambition. For so many in his generation, the ultimate dream was the chance to leave, to cross oceans and borders, to begin again away from the motherland their ancestors had tended for thousands of years. They often chased that vision with such fervor that they rarely paused to consider the price it demanded. Now, these very consequences sat before Ming, heavy and unignorable."}
{"text": "There was no promise of success. He was being thrust into a world that was by every definition, foreign. He had no idea what the competition was like out there, what life was like in an environment where everybody didn’t look like you, talk like you, or act like you, and so what if he couldn’t keep up? If he failed, he would not just be dragging himself down, but his wife and son as well. Was it really fair to ask them to risk so much for a dream that was ultimately, his own?"}
{"text": "He knew his wife’s thoughts on going abroad. She loved their life here in Beijing. She had been an anomaly amongst people of their generation, working tirelessly not to flee what she had been given, but to contribute to it.  And in the past few months, no matter how many arguments he summoned - no matter how insistently he spoke of Yang’s education, of better opportunities, of safer streets and cleaner air - he knew, deep down, that these were half-truths draped over a selfish desire. They were excuses, polished and arranged to obscure what both of them already understood."}
{"text": "This was his dream. And if he failed at it, he would be dragging down a woman who had given up everything to help him pursue it. Ultimately, she had given in, because her love for him trumped any she felt towards her country, but that had only unsettled him all the more. He could not bear the thought of looking back one day, years on, and seeing regret staring back at him through her eyes. And so he knew he could not fail."}
{"text": "None of this deliberation mattered anymore, however. The decision had already been made, and now it felt as though the world itself had begun to move around him, pushing him forward whether he wished it or not. Paperwork had been signed, visas issued, tickets purchased, belongings sorted and packed. Conversations - some whispered late at night, others spoken too loudly in crowded rooms - set in motion a chain of events far larger than any single doubt he now harbored. There was no lever left to pull, no argument left to make, no quiet moment in which to retreat and reconsider. Instead of fighting against the stream, a stream he himself had wanted so desperately to traverse, all he could do now was go along with it."}
{"text": "And so, as he watched his son loop around the same hundred - meter stretch of trail they had been at for the last hour, Ming made a silent promise to himself. No matter how merciless the coming years may be, and even if every sacrifice they had made turned out to be in vain, he alone would bear the blame. If he disappointed his friends, his wife, his family - if he disappointed even himself - so be it. He would still push forward with everything he had. And one day, if his son were to look back and long for the simplicity of his childhood, he would know this: his father had tried, with every ounce of strength he possessed, to turn that unrelenting dream of his into a reality."}
{"text": "As cliche as it was, Yang found himself soothed by the sight of the waves of the Pacific crashing against the shore. Leaning back against the hood of his car, he watched the endless gray ocean stretch into the distance between a sunless sky. And despite everything weighing on him these past months, or perhaps because of it, the only thought that rose to the surface was how beautiful it all looked."}
{"text": "The irony of the thought was not lost on him. Growing up, coming to the beach had been a chore, an obligation he was obligated to fulfill. As far back as he could remember, his father had insisted the family spend their weekend afternoons hiking the trails that lined the Southern Californian coastline. And through the stubborn blindness of childhood, Yang learned to associate the ocean not with wonder, but with disappointment and quiet resentment."}
{"text": "And yet, moving away from his hometown had changed all that for him. Returning home for break, he found that the same streets he once despised now stirred a quiet nostalgia; the same people he’d once thought dull he now loved with an unexpected tenderness. And above all, the beach, once a source of childhood sorrow, was now a source of pride, a gentle refuge against the harshness of the world beyond."}
{"text": "His first semester at university had not gone well. Going in, he had expected New York City to be the beacon of hope, the symbol of promise that the shows and movies had always made it out to be. Instead, he was met with trash filled streets, the sour air of the subway, transactional conversations with shallow people, and an unforgiving academic environment he had no desire to return to."}
{"text": "It had taken no time at all for him to become disillusioned with it all. And in the weeks and months that followed, the only thing he had looked forward to was returning home; to seek out the comfortable familiarity he once was so eager to escape. And now that he was here, he found that familiarity exhilarating. Driving down roads he could navigate blind, surrounded by people he had known for years and years, gave him a sense of comfort he could hardly put into words."}
{"text": "It had not always felt this way. Yang knew that only a few short months earlier, he had been desperate to leave all of this behind. Growing up, he had never truly thought of California as home. To that younger version of himself, home lay across the vast ocean he now stared into. Summer trips to Beijing had stirred that same feeling that the same beaches he had tried so hard to run from now elicited - a kind of yearning he hadn’t known how to name back then."}
{"text": "The root cause of those emotions had been alienation. California had alienated him when he had first come to her sun kissed shores as a timid, wide - eyed child, and New York had done the same thing when he arrived there earlier this year as a young adult. And both times, he had retreated into the familiar as a form of protection. The irony of it now, was that the place that had first alienated him had become the very thing that sheltered him. As time had gone on, In n Out Double Doubles had replaced dumplings as his comfort food, his Mandarin had grown beyond rusty, and the people he called his second family traced their ancestry to Western Eurasia rather than Eastern Eurasia, as his own."}
{"text": "In fact, he remembered how, this past summer when he had gone back to Beijing for the first time since before the lockdowns, he could barely hold a conversation with his taxi drivers and even struggled to read the menus at the restaurants he visited. When at tourist attractions, he found himself drifting toward the Western tour groups, perhaps out of a sense of cultural affiliation, but more so because he couldn’t understand the Mandarin being spoken by the local guides. The city was no longer home to him, not even close. It was alien, just as alien as California had once felt to him, and even more so than New York did now."}
{"text": "And so, despite the isolation he felt there, he knew that those feelings would pass. Perhaps his affection towards the Big Apple would never run as deep as his love for the Golden State, but he also knew that feelings were fickle, and a man’s idea of home even more so. It had taken leaving his whole life behind to make him realize how much he treasured the place he grew up in, and he wasn’t going to make that mistake again with the new life he was trying to build. No matter the hardships he faced, no matter the challenges awaiting him, he would persevere, because he knew that he would never forgive himself if he didn’t at least try. His home, this home, would always remain here, waiting for him. And perhaps in time, he could build a new home for himself, just as his father once had when he first brought their family here."}
{"text": "My life has always been defined by in betweens. Growing up, I felt as if I was always between two worlds: the one my family and I had left behind in China, and the one we were building here in the US. It’s precisely this feeling of being constantly “in between” two places that led me to feel as if I never truly belonged. Summer trips to Beijing brought familiarity to the child version of me, but it was a familiarity that was also marked by a growing sense of distance. Every year I went back, it was as if I became less and less familiar, and grew more and more disillusioned with the place I had left behind."}
{"text": "On the other hand, my new life in the United States was one of constant isolation. It felt as if, no matter how hard I tried, I could never grow used to my new surroundings, so much like Ovid, I was stuck on the edge of the world, constantly reflecting back on an earlier time that was now definitively out of reach for me: not so much because of geographical or political barriers, but simply because of temporal ones."}
{"text": "When I sat down to write this paper, I hadn’t expected how much I would be able to connect these experiences to those of my immediate family. I had grown up hearing stories of my grandfather’s flight from his childhood home on the heels of the Great Leap Forward, of my parent’s experiences with having to come to terms with their places in a newly modernized Chinese society, and finally of the difficulties they encountered on their subsequent journey here to the United States. But, like most children, I never internalized these stories. To me, they were just lectures, childhood lessons of how grateful I should be for the life I led, never did I really think of them as real experiences that directly led me to the life I lived in the modern day."}
{"text": "And so, when I began to do research for how I wanted to portray these stories, which still didn’t seem real to me even when I began to write them down, I never expected to find just how much the process I would go through would humanize them to me. Watching Hinton’s documentations of the lives of Chinese women in rural villages and their descriptions of daily life, listening to college students in 1990s Beijing speaking of struggling with rent, and dealing with their ambitions of moving abroad, all made connecting the experiences I had grown up hearing about to my own so much easier. Because stories are just that: stories. As people, the stories we tell tend to emphasize the dramatic, the fantastical, and that makes it easy for us to see them as works of fiction or tales spun to get at a predefined purpose. When you focus on the mundane and the relatable, and see how they connect to the fantastical, that in turn allows us to connect our everyday experiences to the ones detailed, which makes them all the more real."}
{"text": "I started originally by writing from my personal experiences: beginning with a fictionalized family outing told from my father’s perspective. Set in the Olympic Park on a winter afternoon in 2010, I based this scene off of the memories of many very real outings to the area during that time period (I’ve even included some pictures dated from around that era in this linked folder). While to that little version of myself, those outings represented nothing more than the simplicity of happiness, looking back, I now find myself wondering how much of a role the globalization of the area my family called home played in ultimately influencing the decision of my parents to move us abroad, and whether or not those trips also had the subversive goal of exposing me to what life would be like outside of China, maybe even before any concrete plans to leave the country behind had been developed."}
{"text": "As Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympics Committee stated at the closing ceremony of the 2008 games, “Through these Games, the world learned more about China, and China learned more about the world” (Giulianotti), a sentiment that, in hindsight, seems to have quietly echoed into my own upbringing, as 2008 proved to not only influence an entire nation towards a more globalized way of thinking, but also a small family of three located in northern Beijing as well. By exploring such a simple memory from the perspective of my father, and setting it in what was arguably one of the most international regions of early 21st century Beijing, I attempted to showcase, from a firsthand perspective, the changing perspectives of a people that no longer just looked inwards, but were gradually turning its attentions outwards as well, and the consequences such a shift was already having."}
{"text": "I then began to work backwards. During the summer of 2024, I returned to Beijing for the first time since the lockdowns had begun almost five years earlier (a fact I mentioned in the epilogue), and while hiding from the sweltering heat and humidity of northeastern Asia in late July, I began to flip through old family photo albums carefully curated and preserved for decades by my grandmother. I can’t quite describe the surreality of seeing photographs of my father and his sister as teenagers, or of looking at a pre-retirement version of my Grandmother conduct chemical experiments for use in industrial factories; yet there they were, staring back at me in glossy color, turning the stories I had only known through descriptions during late night dinners and long car rides into real, visible history, and it made me appreciate on a far greater detail that the people that had shaped my life were just that: people, with thoughts, lives, and pasts of their own. However, it was the regularity, the normality of it all that influenced me above all. Seeing cans of Coca - Cola on the table of a family dinner next to my fifteen year old father, a picture of my aunt in the early 90s standing in front of a television set, made the contrast between what I had heard and what I was now seeing all the more pronounced (the referenced pictures are also linked here, I think they’re worth taking a look at). Were these images not just a few years removed from the Tiananmen Square protests my father had participated in firsthand? Was this not the same city that held the dirt roads my parents had to struggle through on their bicycles to get to school everyday? This contrast made me realize that through all the tales of hardship, political upheaval, and superhuman experiences, this was already a country that was becoming grounded in the global economy: foreign brands, consumer electronics, all glimpses of the lives we know today beginning to seep through and merge effortlessly with a world now present only in textbook passages describing tales unimaginable to the modern mind."}
{"text": "It was just this contrast, this change I wanted to explore. As Veronique de Rugy, a researcher on socio-economic trends in recent American history put it so well, “By the late 1990s, Chinese imports to the United States had increased more than sixfold in the decade preceding permanent normal trade relations, and … the rapid growth of Chinese imports into the United States accelerated with deeper integration into the global trading system” (de Rugy), a transformation unfolding not only in ports and policy, but within ordinary households like my own. To trace that change, I turned not to statistics alone but to my father, and to his father before him, whose lives, separated by only a few decades, unfolded in realities so different they scarcely resembled the same country."}
{"text": "Which is why I wanted to begin this story with my grandfather. Born in 1937 to a family of former opium dealers in rural Hebei, his childhood unfolded against a succession of upheavals, each arriving before the last had fully receded. The Japanese invasion and occupation gave way almost immediately to a resumed civil war, which in turn was followed by the onset of the Maoist era and the collectivization it imposed. His life was transformed repeatedly without ever requiring him to leave his ancestral hometown. And yet, in the end, he did leave it, not by choice, but because political forces far beyond his control made staying impossible"}
{"text": "As Wei Li and Dennis Tao Yang note, “By the end of 1958, practically all of China’s rural households — about 98.2 percent and roughly 120 million households — were organized into 26,425 People’s Communes as small private farms and landholdings were dismantled in the drive toward collectivized agriculture” (Li and Yang). My grandfather’s family was amongst them. While never major landlords, their comparatively higher standing in rural society made their fall from grace all the more severe. It was only because my grandfather had been admitted to university in the same year the Great Leap Forward began that he managed to escape the worst consequences of that transformation. To Beijing, moves like these aided in “symbolizing a break with the old society and fundamentally transforming China’s rural social structure” so that “by the early 1950s the revolutionary agenda had brought the Communist Party’s authority into every key urban and rural group” (Britannica). To a modern Western audience, such quotations register as nothing more than statistics and historical footnotes. Yet, to those living through the changing of the times, this represented a fundamental realignment of their entire worldview. Traditional Chinese society had endured in some form or another since long before the days of China being seen as a unified polity, dating to an era when Confucius traveled among rival states nearly three millennia ago. Against this immense historical continuity, the abruptness of the transformation was especially jarring: not only did it break sharply with China’s long established past, but it also foreshadowed the equally sudden and dramatic reorientation of the nation’s destiny in the late twentieth century. By exploring that transformation through a firsthand perspective, I sought to capture the immense scale of that change on a more personal level, and help the reader understand not just the broader historical or socioeconomic implications of such a change, but also the mark it left on the individual and the family structure as well. Because it was that change that laid the foundations for where I am today, and without fully understanding it, how can I hope to understand what led me to become the person I am today?"}
{"text": "In many ways, my family’s story is inseparable from the story of modern China. Through this personal lens, I sought to explore the country’s history in the decades following the founding of the People’s Republic. That story, of China and of my family within it, begins with the dismantling of an old social order and the fracturing of long-standing familial structures. It then moves through a gradual reopening to the outside world, before culminating in both family and nation emerging as participants in an increasingly globalized, interconnected society."}
{"text": "Yet even within this transformed world, many of the same struggles endure: the pressures of adaptation, identity, and belonging have not disappeared with modernization, with immigration abroad; they’ve merely taken on new forms. It was for this reason that I sought to draw a direct line between the challenges faced by my father, his father before him, and those I confront today. Because beneath political, temporal, physical, socioeconomic change, the human experience remains a shared and continuous one. The story that began when my grandfather packed his bags and departed his village for the city continues through me. Though I speak a different language and inhabit an entirely different world, our journeys, at their core, remain the same."}
{"text": "A series of three short stories set in the years 1958, 1994, and 2011, along with an epilogue in 2024, detailing the lives of three generations of a Chinese family. Beginning with the move of grandfather “Cheng” to the city after the loss of his family’s estate to the communes of the Great Leap Forward, to the experiences of his son “Ming” as he prepared to enter university in one of a newly reformed China’s top universities, and finally to Ming’s decision to relocate his own family in 2010 to California. The epilogue will be set in 2024, as Ming’s own son “Yang” returns home from college in New York for the first time since leaving, and reflects on his own struggles to fit in both throughout his childhood and in university."}
{"text": "The three stories will be based on the lives of me, my father, and my grandfather, focusing more on the latter two’s lives as they dealt with how to “belong” in an ever changing China. I want to capture, from a more personal perspective than a history textbook, how real people dealt with the massive changes Chinese society underwent in the 20th century, as well as to detail how these societal changes were reflected in the changes undergone in the lives of ordinary people/families. I feel as if my own family’s history has captured, remarkably well, each of the “phases” China underwent as it changed, and as such, I feel that this piece will not only serve to demonstrate on how my own family found our place in the world, but how China as a whole did so as well."}
{"text": "Many of the texts in the course, specifically those in The Displaced dealt with how individuals found their own way in the societies that they had found themselves in, as they were completely different from the ones they may have come from, and I feel as if these are themes that have been present not only throughout all of my life, but also throughout the lives of every member of my family. I feel as if by exploring the lives of these individuals, I can not only better understand how these changes have impacted me, but also my entire lineage."}
{"text": "To me, many of the authors of the texts from this course talk about two lives: the lives they lead right now, and the ones they used to have, and utilize this contrast between their two lives to talk about their experiences with migration and displacement. Often times these two lives are led in completely separate environments, like Ovid’s reflections on life in the Roman metropole from exile on the frontiers of the empire, but what happens when these two lives are led by the same individuals, in largely the same settings, and only differ significantly because the societies they lead them in are changing on a rapid, fundamental level?"}
{"text": "My grandfather, when he moved to the city for university, went from a small village in Hebei, to a still relatively small city in Shanxi. While this change might sound large, it really wasn’t. Shanxi and Hebei are neighboring provinces, and have very similar cultures, and as someone who grew up in a relatively upper class environment in pre - Maoist China, many of the staples of life you found unique to cities were available to him prior to this period as well. As such, the changes his life underwent were not as a result of any great geographical or cultural changes, but rather as a result of the society that he lived in changing as a whole. How he, and many of his contemporaries dealt with this change, are all themes I want to try and explore in this piece."}
{"text": "The same is true for my father, and the changes his own life underwent. He was born in Beijing, in 1975, during the final year of the Maoist era (on Mao’s last birthday, no less), and as such, he had a front row seat to the endless changes China would undergo in the following decades. Mao’s initial succession crisis, Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms, and the 1989 democracy protests (which he told me he actually briefly participated in as a then thirteen year old middle schooler), all had real, tangible effects on his childhood, and by the time he entered university in 1994 at the age of 18, he would’ve been living in a completely different environment from the one he was born into despite never having moved outside of the same borough. And even his life in 1994 would be completely different from the one he led in 2011, when he decided to take on an opportunity to move to California, and I think by reflecting on just some of the changes one family’s life would undergo in such a short period of time, I can also help to better capture just how much society in China as a whole was changing."}

Having been an outside witness to its development over the last decade, the country has fascinated me, which is why the opportunity to do a summer semester in Shanghai seemed so appealing to me. As the most multicultural city in China, Shanghai seems to be a natural fit for me, and as a main campus for NYU, it also has several of the courses I want to take to complete my major."}
{"text": "Going abroad to Shanghai would allow me to reconnect with my roots, and also allow me to get the chance to travel around China on my own. NYU Shanghai seems to be a natural fit for me, as it gives me the opportunity to both study and reconnect with a culture I had left behind at a young age, when I moved to the United States from Beijing. I truly hope the decisions committee in Shanghai will accept me as a candidate to study abroad there."}
{"text": "Dune, the 1965 genre defining novel by Frank Herbert, is set in a distant, feudal future in which power and politics are defined by the whims and priorities of great families of nobles. Paul Atreides, the protagonist of the first two novels of the franchise, is one such noble who is forced into exile in the deserts of the central planet of the universe, Arrakis, after a brutal surprise attack on his family’s strongholds by their long-time rivals, the Harkonnens. This exile, however, is what also allows him to win the loyalty of the Fremen, the natives of Arrakis, and by utilizing their martial prowess to lure the Emperor and the great houses into a one-sided battle in the desert, he emerges as the supreme, Padishah Emperor of the universe."}
{"text": "Much of this story may be well known to the reader, thanks to Denis Villeneuve's two part film adaptation of the first novel Dune. Dune Messiah, its sequel, may be less familiar, but is equally, if not more deserving of attention; set ten years after the end of Dune, Paul Atreides, now at the head of a galactic jihad that has killed billions, is coming to terms with not only the consequences of his crimes, but also his prescient powers that played a major role in his rise to power. Having witnessed a horrible, unchangeable future, and becoming a slave to it due to the nature of prescience itself, he spends much of the novel in turmoil, wrestling with his all-knowing abilities. After the death of his Fremen concubine Channi in childbirth towards the end of the book, Paul, now blinded thanks to an attack by a faction wishing to rid mankind of its tyrant Emperor, walks into self imposed exile in the deserts of Arrakis, abdicating his throne and rejecting both the past he has created, and the future he is forever a subservient to."}
{"text": "Both the themes of exile and knowledge are explored heavily by Herbert within these novels. Exile throughout the novels serves as ways of not only escaping the present, but also the future, and as a method to both gain power, and lose it. Knowledge (of the future), while not exactly sought after by Paul throughout the series, is heavily pushed onto him, and after attaining it, he not only becomes an isolated, messianic figure to his former friends and allies, but also a slave to the terrible consequences it brings. Herbert, a well known Grecophile (the surname Atreides is derivative of Atreus, the famous figure from Greek mythology) undoubtedly took heavy influence from the works of Sophacles two thousand years earlier, and most notably his timeless classic, Oedipus Rex."}
{"text": "In the play, Oedipus, fleeing his home of Corinth to avoid the consequences of a prophecy revealed to him by an oracle, encounters a Sphinx while on the road to Thebes. After having answered the riddle posed to him by the creature, he is welcomed into the city as a hero, crowned its king, and marries the widow of his predecessor. Years after his ascension, a terrible plague comes to the city, and the Oracle of Delphi reveals that for it to be lifted, the killer of Oedipus’ predecessor must be punished first. In a mad quest to ensure a return to stability in his fiefdom, Oedipus not only makes it a priority to discover who the killer is, but also encounters a horrible truth; he himself is responsible. This realization ensures that both the Delphic and Corinthic prophecies were fulfilled, and in a fit of despair, he blinds himself and flees into exile, seeking to punish himself for his sins, never to return to his native land again."}
{"text": "Clear parallels can be drawn between Sophacles’ and Herbert’s works. Exile allows the protagonists in both stories to not only achieve power, but also serves as an escape/punishment for them. Knowledge of the future enslaves both men, driving them mad in their attempts to escape fate, ultimately culminating in their surrender to it. These are themes that far transcend the works of literature in which they are presented, they represent universal truths present throughout human history: we see isolation as a means of escape from the issues that plague our present, and we constantly pursue knowledge, sometimes to the very detriment of ourselves."}
{"text": "Isolation, for example, is constantly brought up by Sophacles as a means of escaping the present nature of Oedipus’ life. In setting up the initial conditions that led to his arrival in Thebes, Oedipus states that “I heard all that and ran. I abandoned Corinth, from that day on I gauged its landfall only by the stars, running, always running toward some place where I would never see the shame of all those oracles come true” (Sophocles, 205). Exile served him as a convenient escape from forces that may otherwise bring an unwanted present to bear. He sought desperately to escape destiny, and tried by physically leaving behind the totality of all that he knew. And in contrast to this, upon the realization of the twist of fate that had befallen him at the end, Oedipus again states “No more—it's wrong to name what's wrong to do. Quickly, for the love of god, hide me somewhere, kill me, hurl me into the sea where you can never look on me again” (Sophocles, 244). Now, instead of serving as protection, isolation serves him as a means of escape from the consequences and shame that are a direct result of his past decisions. Retreating from human sight (both by running away and by blinding himself) are the only ways in which he believes he can redeem himself, or merely even cushion the blow from what he has done. It illustrates his seeing of exile as a means of severing ties with the issues that plague him and as a source of redemption, directly mirroring societal views on the subject. Mankind has long seen removal from society as a means of not only escape from one’s present situation: as is symbolized through our romanticization of life on the frontier, or enlistment in the armed forces, but also as a way of punishing criminals for their wrongdoings: solitary confinement is oftentimes the harshest form of punishment (barring the death penalty) capable of being handed out. Much like how Paul Atreides used the desert as a conduit of power and an oasis of punishment, Oedipus utilizes self imposed exile as a way of escaping his present, both to outrun destiny, and finally to punish himself for fulfilling it."}
{"text": "The pursuit of knowledge, meanwhile, plays the role of both contrasting and paralleling the one isolation plays in the story. Whereas isolation is utilized by Oedipus to try and escape from the horror revealed to him through oracle, the pursuit of knowledge serves him as a means of solving the crises befalling him, and however well intentioned, ultimately plays the final role in his downfall. Even despite the warning posed to him by Teiresias stating “How terrible—to see the truth when the truth is only pain to him who sees! I knew it well, but I put it from my mind, else I never would have come” (Sophocles, 176), and the pleas by his own wife, Jocasta, who stated, “Stop—in the name of god, if you love your own life, call off this search! My suffering is enough” (Sophocles, 222), Oedipus pressed ahead, unwavering in his desires to uncover the truth behind the death of his predecessor, ultimately leading to his final realization of the truth, stating: “O god—all come true, all burst to light! O light—now let me look my last on you! I stand revealed at last—cursed in my birth, cursed in marriage, cursed in the lives I cut down with these hands!” (Sophocles, 232). Tragedies such as this have undoubtedly played out countless times throughout human history. Oppenheimer’s relentless pursuit of fission led him to develop a bomb which unleashed the potential to wipe out civilization, serving as the source of his greatest regret. Alfred Nobel’s invention of dynamite, originally intended for civilian and commercial use, played a key role in the industrialization of warfare. Individuals throughout history have consistently pursued knowledge without fear of its consequences, and Sophacles’ two thousand year old tragedy only serves to highlight how ancient these desires run. And much as Paul Atreides’ power of foresight drove him to wander into the desert in pursuit of an escape from torment, Oedipus’ revelation of himself being the killer of King Laius caused him to take his own vision, and exile himself voluntarily from the city that had made him king."}
{"text": "It seems as if then, that it is ingrained in human nature to not only attempt to outrun our problems, but also to seek knowledge at all costs, however detrimental it may be to ourselves. Stories both written and set thousands of years apart follow the tales of men who used exile as means of escape, and knowledge as the ultimate factor that led to their fall from power. The fact that in Sophocles and Oedipus Rex, Frank Herbert did not merely see an ancient tragedy, but also a tale relevant for his contemporary time states all that is needed about the timeless nature of the Greek classic. As long as mankind lives on, we will forever be plagued by the allure of escape and the curse of knowledge."}

{"text": "“The Last Emperor”, a 1987 biopic by Bernardo Bertolucci, is a film covering the life and misfortunes of Puyi, the last emperor of China. It was a movie that I discovered, by chance, as a poster on the wall of a cinema I visited during a field trip in middle school. A striking, unique image, it featured a young boy adorned with a comically large Manchu headgear, standing in front of a seemingly endless crowd of faceless officials all while the enormous gates of the Forbidden City towered over them."}
{"text": "Until I saw that poster, I had never understood the meaning of the phrase “a picture can portray a thousand words”. As a citizen of the 21st century, I grew up taking for granted the ability to be able to capture the world around me at a whim, and this desensitization had long led me to stop trying to find the value in imagery."}
{"text": "Yet, there was something peculiar about the picture that caused the film to stick with me. Questions about who this boy was, why those men were seemingly worshiping him, and most importantly, what led him to wear such a large hat, all lingered in the back of my mind for days afterwards, only slowly fading with the passage of time."}
{"text": "Years later, as I was searching for a way to occupy a Saturday night, that poster of The Last Emperor appeared back in my mind. Like an itch that I simply had to scratch, the image I had seen so long ago, combined with a newfound love of history, led me to commit my evening to screening the nearly three hour long film. Within just minutes of the opening shot, as I immersed myself in the gritty atmosphere of 1950s China, I had fallen in love."}
{"text": "Looking back, I realize now that the reason the Last Emperor had stuck with me for so long was not just its contents, but what it represented.  My fascination with the movie went deeper than just its poster and its cinematography, it developed from an innate desire to chip away at the mystery that China and its culture had long occupied within my mind. Despite having spent the first years of my life there, growing up in the United States had led me to become disconnected with the culture I was born into, and perhaps when I first glanced upon that poster of a boy who seemed so foreign, and yet so familiar, it revealed a part of myself that even I was unaware of."}
{"text": "I grew up in a bicultural, seemingly contradictory world. There was the culture of my home, surrounded by Mandarin and the customs of a country half a world away, and then there was the culture of the outside, filled with English and social norms initially unfamiliar to me. This sharp contrast had, at first, led me to feel alienated from my peers, which is why for much of my childhood I subconsciously searched for a way of rectifying the two worlds of my life with one another. Yet, it also led me to grow estranged from both cultures. At school, I constantly felt like an outsider, terrified of showing any form of incongruence that could lead me to be perceived as different, and back home, to be able to fit in with this new world around me, I slowly dropped aspects of Chinese culture to be able to better assimilate into wider society. Striking a balance between these two aspects of my life grew to encompass everything I did, so much so that overtime I stopped even realizing I was doing it."}
{"text": "I believe this was the reason that The Last Emperor left such a deep impression on me. Seeing that poster on the wall had unlocked a part of myself that I had forced myself to hide for years. A desire to be proud of the culture I came from, expressed through seeing a boy who looked just like me on the big screen. To show the world that where I came from was not that different from where I eventually ended up, and that I did not need to hide behind the facade of uniformity."}
{"text": "In his essay, “A Too Perfect Picture” Teju Cole explores the idea of how art can characterize our perceptions of cultures by contrasting the works of two photographers, Steve McCurry and Raghubir Singh, and their portrayals of India during the second half of the 20th century. Cole writes that “In McCurry’s portraits, the subject looks directly at the camera, wide-eyed and usually marked by some peculiar­ity … The photographs … are popular in part because they evoke an earlier time in Indian history, as well as old ideas of what photographs of Indians should look like … umbrellas, looms, sewing machines; not laptops, wireless printers, escalators”, before contrasting this with Singh’s photos, which he states “...gives us photographs charged with life: not only beautiful experiences or painful scenes but also those in-between moments of drift that make up most of our days … he took pictures of everything: cities, towns, villages, shops, rivers, worshipers, workers, construction sites, motorbikes, statues, modern furniture, balconies, suits, dresses and, sure, turbans and saris.” (Cole)."}
{"text": "While both men portray India during a similar time period, McCurry’s India is one dotted with tradition, purposely depicted as lacking in modernity and playing into the fantasy of an India still stuck in the past. It’s a portrayal that plays to the imaginations of audiences outside of the country itself, and serves only as a continuation of the long foregone myth of Indian ‘backwardness’. In contrast, while Singh’s photos may include many of the same fixtures typical of McCurry photos, the difference is clear through his willingness to depict reality; Singh is not afraid to show off the fixtures of modern life, however unappealing they may be, and through this he is able to create an image of India far more complex than that of McCurry’s. As Cole puts it, “the uniqueness of any given country is a mixture not only of its indigenous practices and borrowed customs but also of its past and its present” (Cole). To be able to truly portray a culture, it’s not enough to just focus on a singular aspect of it; we must consider both the past and present, the popular and the forgotten about, and only then, can we truly capture the essence of a people."}
{"text": "One of my favorite scenes from the Last Emperor is Puyi’s second coronation. Taking place in Manchuria after the Japanese invasion in 1931, we follow Puyi as he is once again crowned as Emperor, this time as the puppet ruler of the Japanese client state Manchukuo. Everything from the costume design of the set (a mix of traditional Chinese Qipaos and modern, western tuxedos), to the backdrop of the scene itself (with the coronation taking place in a wide open field, directly in front of a massive industrial plant) shows off a mixture of modernity and traditionalism. Old superstitions combined with aspects of industrial society mix together to show us a picture of China as a whole during that time period. I think a quote from Puyi’s mistress summarizes it well, “it looks like the inauguration of a factory!” (The Last Emperor 2:33:04 - 2:36:52)."}
{"text": "Much like Singh, Bertolucci’s depiction of China in the Last Emperor is one that utilizes both a mixture of fantasy and reality, and through this, he was able to portray a view of China that linked directly to the China I had been born into. Bertolucci depicted a country dominated by realism, and plagued by the problems of modernity, yet at the same time coexisting with the fantastical, almost overly-stereotyped elements of China’s past. Elaborate coronations against the backdrops of factories, Scottish tutors wearing Manchurian headgear, and a teenage Emperor riding around the Forbidden City on a bicycle all serve to demonstrate to the viewer this idea that while China is an old nation with old beliefs, it was still a nation, and not just a faraway, fairytale land. And it was a view I sought to convey to the world about myself; that while I may have been born into a different culture from those around me, I was, myself, not so different from them."}
{"text": "Yet, to me, the struggle to reconnect with my past was just half of the story. The other half revolved around discovering what had made me lose touch with my heritage in the first place. As a child, I had come to the United States knowing less than ten words of English, and my only exposure to American culture had been through cartoons poorly dubbed in Mandarin. How was it, that at the time of my high school graduation, I was giving speeches in English in front of hundreds of people, and had assimilated to the point of shunning steam boiled fish and Peking duck in favor of burgers from In-n-Out and sandwiches from Subway?"}
{"text": "Richard Rodriguez, a Mexican American author born in San Francisco, asked a similar  question in his essay “Aria: A Memoir of a Bilingual Childhood”. Much like me, Rodriguez had entered the American schooling system “able to understand about fifty stray English words” (Rodriguez, 1), and had spent his early years speaking only in the language of his family, Spanish. Through this, he learned to develop in his head a separation between “español… a private language, my family’s language”, and English, “the language of public society” (Rodriguez, 7). But it was also this distinction that Rodriguez believed “...deepened and strengthened my feeling of public separateness”; to be able to fit in, he believed that he had  “…the right, and the obligation, to speak the public language” (Rodriguez, 6)."}
{"text": "Yet, Rodriguez states that “As I became fluent in English, I could no longer speak Spanish with confidence. I continued to understand spoken Spanish, and in high school, I learned how to read and write Spanish. But for many years I could not pronounce it” (Rodriguez, 12). This resulted in him feeling isolated from the rest of his family, and from his heritage as a whole. Recalling childhood memories of visits by relatives, Rodriguez says that “...they would say, we want you to speak to us in Spanish (‘en español’). But I couldn’t do it. Then they would call me Pocho … an adjective meaning ‘colorless’ or ‘bland.” (Rodriguez, 14)."}
{"text": "Rodriguez’s struggles echo those of my own. Throughout my childhood, I gradually dropped my ability to speak Mandarin in favor of fitting in better with ‘public society’. Overtime, I would lose much of my grasp on the language, similar to Rodriguez’s own struggles with Spanish, and it resulted in a feeling of isolation from my family. During summer trips back to China, I would find the roles reversed from how they were when I had first arrived in America, with me now struggling to fit in with Chinese public society."}
{"text": "But are these struggles inherently problems on their own? Is dropping one’s native culture in favor of fitting in with wider American society an issue worth addressing? The United States is commonly referred to as a ‘melting pot’, but in a real melting pot, are foods supposed to blend with one another, or remain separate? Rodriguez addressed these issues through the context of an, at the time, recent idea known as ‘Bilingual Education’."}
{"text": "Rodriguez states that, “Supporters of bilingual education imply today that students like me miss a great deal by not being taught in their family’s language. What they seem not to recognize is that, as a socially disadvantaged child, I regarded Spanish as a private language” (Rodriguez, 7). To him, the idea of teaching the children of immigrant families in their native languages only serves to “trivialize the nature of intimate life” (Rodriguez, 3) and the idea of him being taught in Spanish and not in English would have only “delayed… learning the great lesson of school: that I had a public identity” (Rodriguez, 7)."}
{"text": "Following the publication of Rodriguez’s essay in the 80s, he faced intense backlash from the Mexican American community in the United States for his beliefs on bilingual education, with many calling him derogatory terms like ‘pocho’ or ‘coconut’. Many believed that Rodriguez was betraying both his family and his culture by suggesting that schools should be prioritizing integration over cultural individuality, so this raises the question: is Rodriguez wrong? Does assimilation only lead to negative fallout for immigrant families? Should we be doing more to ensure that the children of immigrants are able to retain as much of their heritage as possible, even if it comes at the cost of isolation from public life?"}
{"text": "As an immigrant myself, sympathizing with Rodriguez’s detractors would be easy, yet, I find myself in agreement with him. Despite the isolation I felt throughout the early stages of my childhood, the experiences I garnered from my archetypal American education has allowed me to forge a bond with not only those I grew up with, but with wider ‘public society’ as a whole. Today, I no longer fear asking for directions in grocery stores, or going out with friends, or even being perceived as an ‘outsider’, because despite the challenges I’ve faced throughout my life, overcoming them has allowed for me to find peace with my place in society, not as a distant observer, but as an individual clog in a much larger machine."}
{"text": "It’s as Rodriguez says, “In public … full individuality is achieved, paradoxically, by those who are able to consider themselves members of the crowd” (Rodriguez, 12). We cannot focus on our cultural or ethnic individuality as the sole source of our personalities; doing so only inhibits our potential. Much like Cole’s belief that art is only enhanced through our ability to capture all the various facets that make up a work, so too is a society only enhanced by our ability to include a wide array of cultures, not as a conglomerate of separate pieces, but as a vast blend of colors that make up a wider tapestry."}
{"text": "I do not perceive myself as a person defined by my cultural background, but rather by the experiences I’ve had throughout my life. My desk in California might be dotted by souvenirs from Shanghai and Beijing, and my bookshelf filled with translated Chinese novels, my walls are also lined with posters of artists like Noah Kahan or the Lumineers, and I still prefer a medium - rare steak over noodles any day of the week. My individuality comes from not just the language I speak at home, but also from the friends I’ve made and the memories we’ve shared. To me, a perfect society should not try and maintain every aspect of a person’s native culture, but rather strip down the barriers that allow for them to remain disconnected from those around them. True individuality comes from learning to adapt to the world around you, and to fit in with it while still maintaining a sense of self, whether that be through private languages, private relationships, or private cultural experiences."}
{"text": "At the end of the Last Emperor, Puyi is released from prison (where he had been placed for collaboration with the Japanese) not as an Emperor, but rather as a simple gardener (The Last Emperor 3:22:57 - 3:25:56). Despite his low status, Puyi the gardener was far happier than he had been in his previous life as an Emperor, because he was finally just another cog in wider society, free from the burdens of politics and power. Through this we are able to see himself express his own individuality for the first time in his life, finally not a puppet of court eunuchs or the Japanese military. It is through this that the ultimate power of public society is shown."}

{"text": "In an era of unprecedented levels of human displacement, migration is often reduced to abstract statistics and painted as an immediate, unprecedented issue born of moral binaries and extrahuman forces. The reality, however, is far more complex and difficult to navigate, and involves utilizing mixtures of different approaches to come to a holistic understanding of the situation at hand. Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot and Ai Wei Wei’s Human Flow are two complementary avenues that do so, giving us examples of uncertainty, exclusion, and revealing how not only how our modern system of borders and citizenship often produce individuals forever suspended in limbo, but also the societal psychology that led to their development. By exploring the subject through these two varying perspectives: contrasting Beckett’s abstractions and symbolism with Ai’s realism and groundedness, we’re able to not only understand the psychological causes behind displacement, but also understand the structural conditions that shape migration in the modern world."}
{"text": "In Samuel Beckett’s 1953 play, Waiting for Godot, we follow two men, Vladimir and Estragon, who spend their days waiting beside a barren road for a figure named Godot, whose arrival is repeatedly promised but never fulfilled. Though they consider leaving at various points throughout the play, they remain immobilized by the expectation of Godot’s eventual coming, thus centering the play around a cyclical pattern of anticipation, frustration, and stasis. Writing less than a decade removed from the Second World War, and during the height of the postwar migration crisis plaguing Central and Eastern Europe, Beckett was no doubt heavily influenced by the plight of Czechs, Poles, Germans, and all the various ethnicities whose lives had been interrupted by the brutality of the war years. As such, the repeated cycle of anticipation and hopelessness in Waiting for Godot can thus be seen as both a commentary on the nationalistic fervor that had led to the outbreak of war, and a critique of the ideological divide that blinded Beckett’s contemporaries to prolonging the crisis. At the start of the play, for example, as Estragon struggles with his boot, he complains to Vladimir, “Nothing to be done” (Beckett, 7). Highlighting the pair’s exhaustion with their circumstances, we can draw direct parallels between them and the widespread sense of fatigue which permeated much of Europe in the years following the Second World War. As individuals began to deal with its aftermath and face not only the economic and human costs of it, but also the social and psychological consequences it was having on ethnic identity and ideological disorientation, a sense of hopelessness began to ring out. In response, governments often resorted to radical yet backward-looking solutions, such as the forced resettlement of Poles from Soviet - annexed territories into German lands, and other mass population transfers that attempted to resolve modern problems using the logic of the old order. Rather than breaking the cycle of displacement, these measures merely reproduced it. Echoing this, when the pair begin morbidly debating the subject of whether or not to end their own lives, Estragon and Vladimir state, “Don't let's do anything. It's safer” “Let's wait and see what he [Godot] says” (Beckett, 12). After waiting for days for the arrival of Godot, and seeing no visible change progress, the pair decide upon suicide as the only way to escape the hopelessness of their reality. Even when faced with the finality of their decision, they never act, mirroring the paralysis of a continent unable to act decisively in the depths of crisis. Although new ideologies had spread across Europe, they often replicated the same structures that had only led to past catastrophes. When Europe became divided into East and West, millions sought to flee the Soviet Union and its satellite states, and power dynamics remained fundamentally unchanged, only rebranded under new flags and governments. Finally, perhaps mirroring the cynicism of Beckett’s contemporaries, the play ends as the two debate the idea of their parting ways, stating “It's not worthwhile now” “Well, shall we go?” “Yes, let's go”, only for stage direction to undercut their words: “They do not move” (Beckett, 60). Despite recognizing the futility of waiting, they remain frozen, extolling change while embodying stagnation. In this final scene, Beckett mirrors a Europe seemingly trapped in an endless cycle of war, displacement, and the reassertion of familiar norms. It is here that Waiting for Godot’s relevance to the history of human migration becomes clearest. Even as societies acknowledge the magnitude of displacement, as was the case in a Europe reshaped by the movement of millions, they struggle to articulate frameworks that can bring about any meaningful change. What results is repetition: a cycle that continues into the modern day, as refugees from Ukraine and the Middle East face the same challenges that those from Poland or the Baltics faced seventy years ago."}
{"text": "While Waiting for Godot’s abstract approach to representing migration allows audiences to grasp its psychological causes and the systemic causes that perpetuate it, to understand the immediate causes driving refugees in the modern day, a more concrete lens is needed. Ai Wei Wei’s 2017 documentary Human Flow, centered around the Middle Eastern refugee crisis and its global impacts offers this perspective. Rather than relying on distant statistics or generalized news coverage, Ai focuses on intimate, personal encounters with both those fleeing their homelands, and those inhabiting the countries to which they migrate to. Early in the film, Ai holds an interview with a father cradling his newborn while on a boat departing Greece, capturing the man’s hopes of reaching a country that will assist him so he can one day repay that kindness (Ai, 15:38 - 16:03). Moments like these help the viewer bridge the gap between individual experiences and the overall situation, transforming a global narrative into interpersonal stories. While only a small fraction of individuals in the West will ever flee their homes and seek refuge in a foreign country, the desire to pursue a better future for your children is one that is universal to the human experience, and by centering the narrative on that perspective, the audience is led to move beyond the image of refugees as being faceless masses, and instead recognize them as individuals with familiar outlooks, aspirations, values, and fears. Ai then extends this humanizing approach by turning the camera toward those tasked with enforcing borders. In a later sequence, Hungarian border guards speak candidly about their longing to take leave and return home to their families while continuing to patrol the Serbian border (29:36 - 32:02). By juxtaposing these perspectives, the film resists the binary approach traditional narratives of the situation take, revealing the crisis as one not sustained by mere abstract forces, but by ordinary people navigating their duties and desires. By doing so, Human Flow renders the refugee crisis not only as a geopolitical emergency, but as a human one, shaped by human perspectives and experiences on all sides."}
{"text": "Only after seeing migration and displacement from both perspectives can we begin to truly understand the root causes behind our modern day crisis. Both the psychological and the physical act as counterweights to one another in helping the informed reader resist traditional boolean narratives of a situation so crucial to understanding the contemporary global landscape. Through Waiting for Godot, Beckett illustrates the former through portraying two men waiting for the ever-elusive Godot to arrive and resolve their problems, echoing society’s tendency to defer responsibility to an imagined future rather than confront crises through action in the present. In contrast, Ai Wei Wei’s Human Flow visualizes the latter by grounding the refugee crisis in personal narratives drawn from individuals on both sides of displacement, transcending the overall situation to highlight its human character. Taken together, both works guide the audience towards the understanding that few modern problems, least of all migration, can be reduced to simple moral binaries."}

{"text": "I’ve always wanted to get more into eating healthily. While I think that I live a pretty healthy lifestyle (working out everyday, getting 10,000 steps in daily, etc.), I’ve realized that when it comes to my diet, I tend to be pretty lax with the things I eat. While it’s not unhealthy by any means, I believe that by optimizing the nutrients I take in on a daily basis, I could improve not only the amount of energy I have throughout the day, but also my ability to focus and my productivity in general. Overall though, I believe I live a very healthy lifestyle, and my main priority right now is to ensure that I can carry on with things as they are."}
{"text": "I’ve realized over the last year that because I lead such a healthy lifestyle, I have been able to inspire many of my friends to live healthier lives of their own. Whether it’s inspiring my friends to go to the gym more, or to wake up earlier, my lifestyle has had a noticeable impact on those around me. I think that to be a good leader, you should hold yourself to a higher standard than those around you, in order to instill a subconscious idea of leadership into those around you."}
{"text": "People want leaders they can look up to, while also being able to relate to them on an interpersonal level. This is the reason why our society idealizes celebrities so much; they are both symbols of excellence for people to aspire to, but also symbols of humanity for them to relate to."}
{"text": "By emulating these principals, even in small ways like the lifestyle you lead, we are able to become better leaders by naturally instilling this idea of leadership into the minds of those around us. I think that this is something I have learned subconsciously throughout my life, but by finally vocalizing these thoughts, I’ve been able to set a new goal for myself to achieve."}
{"text": "When I was growing up, I always felt like the odd one out at school. Having moved to the United States at the age of five, I spent the first few years of my K - 12 career desperately struggling to catch up with my peers, both in my linguistic abilities and in a cultural context. Because of this, I constantly felt ostracized by my peers. No matter what I did, no matter how hard I tried, I could never fit in with them, resulting in my feeling chronically lonely for those first few years of my academic life."}
{"text": "This all changed sometime during the 3rd grade. This was when I met the person who would become my best friend for the next few years, Grady. On the surface, Grady was no different from those who had shunned me for years. Yet, it was him who, for the first time since I had moved to California, showed me kindness, and allowed me to feel like I belonged. And for that, I am forever grateful, because those actions set me down the path that would lead me to where I am today."}
{"text": "Kindness is seen by many in our modern world as a sign of weakness. “Empathy is sin”, so people say, yet that couldn’t be further from the truth. All the great leaders of our past have shown kindness and compassion in their own way, and all the great villains of history have been those who lacked these traits. To be kind is to show those you lead that you are someone worthy of being followed, someone who truly cares about the causes that they represent, and not just someone who is simply seeking personal gain."}
{"text": "This is why I make showing kindness a matter of the highest priority in my life."}
{"text": "Ever since I’ve been at NYU, I’ve made it a priority to get up early everyday to go to the gym before my classes in the morning. I got into this habit because I realized that after exercising in the mornings, I would always have more energy to deal with the rest of my day."}
{"text": "Shortly after starting this routine, I noticed that my energy levels throughout the day increased considerably. I was more productive, less stressed, and generally functioned better as an individual. Because of my experience with my own schedule, I’m extremely inclined to agree with Dr. Brown’s assertion that play, whether it be exercise or any other activity that allows us to simply destress, plays a vital role in ensuring our wellness as people."}
{"text": "I think that as leaders, we should always be extremely mentally agile. And a key part of mental agility comes from learning to relax your brain, and just allowing yourself to decompress. By incorporating Dr. Brown’s ideas play into my everyday life, I am able to become a better leader simply by ensuring I provide myself with the mental headspace to be able to relax and ensure my own wellbeing."}
{"text": "This, in turn, allows me to become a better leader because I know that my decisions are clearly communicated and coherently planned, something that comes about largely as a result of my commitment to the idea of “play”."}
{"text": "One of my earliest childhood memories is of my grandmother, holding my hand, and taking me to my preschool in Beijing. Due to the realities of Chinese work culture, my parents had a very hectic work schedule, and as a result, for the first few years of my life my grandparents were my primary source of care, supplanting the roles of my father and mother as they worked long hours to provide for our family. This led me to develop a very special bond, especially with my grandmother, a bond I struggled to let go of for years after my family had moved to the United States, leaving them behind in China."}
{"text": "Such is the reality of life. Slowly, I got used to the impermanent nature of things, and adjusted to the fact that everything around me was constantly changing. This all changed, just last month, a few short days after New Years, when I was woken up in the middle of the night by my mother, shaking me awake and telling me to get dressed; as it turns out, my grandmother had passed away the previous night, and my father was scrambling to get on the next flight to Beijing."}
{"text": "We drove through the dead of night, and as I watched the lights flash by on the interstate, I couldn’t help but think back on the ten years that had passed since I had left my grandmother’s side. So much had changed, yet, despite the distance that separated us, she had always remained a constant presence in my life. Just the knowledge that she was a phone call away had allowed me to persevere through so much; it made the realization that she was gone just that much harder."}
{"text": "Until that point, I had believed that I had built up an immunity to change. After all, once you’ve learned how to adjust to a completely new country, it seems as if the world is your oyster. My grandma’s passing put an end to such delusions. The next few weeks were extremely tough for me. Despite the fact that I might have told myself I was fine, the reality was, I fell apart. It was as if the dam holding back the reality of life from my mind had burst, and I was struggling more than ever to deal with it. Every form of change, whether that be adjusting to college or leaving my friends and family behind all seemed insurmountable to me."}
{"text": "Now, a month later, I am finally beginning to get back on my feet. Yet, I know now that things have changed. I am not immune to change, I know that now; the hardest part is, deciding how to proceed from here."}
{"text": "Jalaludin Rumi’s Guest House is a short poem outlining a method for which people should try and process the various emotions they deal with throughout their lives. He utilizes a guest house as a metaphor for the brain, and speaks of welcoming in new emotions into the brain as one would welcome guests into a guest house, embracing them instead of rejecting them, as they can aid in personal growth. As someone currently undergoing tremendous change in my personal life, I find this idea both unfamiliar, yet appealing."}
{"text": "Understanding how to process one’s emotions is a natural fact of life, and I believe that the first step to doing this is to undergo a process similar to what Rumi suggests: welcoming all emotions into your life, no matter how you may feel about them, as they can only help you grow. While optimistic emotions like happiness, excitement, or pride may be easy for me to process, I’ve often found it difficult to process anger, sadness, jealousy, or all the other negative emotions in my life, and I believe that this is something I have to work on personally if I am going to be able to grow as a person."}
{"text": "I think emotional maturity is one of the fundamental cornerstones of leadership. How can someone who does not possess full mastery over their own mind ever hope to become a leader of others? Having a complete grasp over one’s emotions should be a requirement to all those who seek to be seen as someone who leads, as the ability to make holistic, mature decisions is not something that someone without the right mental headspace can do; the good captain will choose to go down with his vessel not because it is expected of him, but because he has accepted the emotional responsibility of his ship the first day he took command of it."}
{"text": "I’ve always had a difficult relationship with anger. I’ve been a people pleaser for as long as I can remember, and because of that, I often struggle to place myself and my emotions first, including anger. Anger is an emotion I have spent most of my life suppressing, because I’m afraid that if I express it, people will think poorly of me, something I have always been terrified of."}
{"text": "Because of this, I’ve always thought of anger as being an exclusively negative emotion. To me, it’s something that can only bring harm to both myself, and those around me, which is why Lama Owen’s views on the emotion are so fascinating to me. It made me realize that anger might not only be a harbinger of harm, but also something that can be used to improve ourselves. Much like a scale, our emotions need to be balanced in order for us to function, and I think that fits of anger could simply just be our body expressing an imbalance within ourselves."}
{"text": "Lama Owens also touches upon the ability of individual healing to benefit everyone around us, a viewpoint that I’ve long held. I have always been a believer in the idea that you cannot do harm to yourself by doing good for those around you, and vice versa. Keeping in line with this idea, I’ve been volunteering with a Taiwanese Volunteering Agency named Tzu Chi since my Sophomore year of high school. Through them, I’ve been able to do real good for the community around me, whether that be in my hometown in California or here in New York City. Events like handing out Christmas presents to families down by the Mexican border, or hosting a food pantry for the elderly in Chinatown have allowed me to live my life by the principles that both Lama Owens and myself espouse."}
{"text": "I’ve always been very hard on myself. Maybe it stems from my childhood, but I’ve always held myself to a very high standard of excellence, and because of this, when I fail, I tend to have a hard time forgiving myself."}
{"text": "All my life I’ve been told that “failure is a natural part of life”. Yet, to me, it’s never felt this way. I’m very easily discouraged; a bad test score, a rude remark on the street, or the wrong reaction from a friend are all enough to send me spiraling, and I struggle to get back on my feet afterwards. It’s one of the parts of myself that I detest the most; being physically unable to fail in my mind, I constantly sought perfection, and because of this, I tended to fail even harder at the things I’m not good at."}
{"text": "Yet, since I’ve started college, I’ve realized that this way of living isn’t sustainable. We all fail, but what really differentiates the good from the bad is how you handle that failure. Adaptability is also another key part of life, and it’s a part of myself I’ve only recently begun to learn how to get used to."}
{"text": "I think that being able to fail, and thus being able to show vulnerability, is probably one of the most important skills a leader can have. Oftentimes, people will want to follow those within whom they can see themselves within, because it allows them to form a stronger attachment with them. Failure, and by extension, vulnerability, is the greatest way a leader can humanize themselves with the people that they lead. It allows for those under them to see themselves within their leaders, and only strengthen the bond within a team."}
{"text": "I’m a big believer in the idea that “if you love what you do, you never have to work a day in your life”. I think that passion is a crucial component behind being motivated, and that’s why I found Webb’s How to have a Good Day to be so relatable. Looking back, for much of my life, while I considered myself to be hard working, I wasn’t always motivated. Whether that be in school, or in the workplace, if I was given a task, I would do it, but I wouldn’t always devote one hundred percent of my effort to it."}
{"text": "That’s why Omad Safi’s The Disease of Being Busy felt like an intrusion into my soul. All my life I have correlated value with business; whether that be with schoolwork, with internships, with jobs, etc. Maybe it comes from the highly competitive environment I grew up, or the culture that I was born into, but to me, I’ve always equated the idea of idleness with laziness or worthlessness. It’s what made me spend hours upon hours of my childhood reading and studying, it’s what made high school me neglect my relationships to focus on schoolwork and extracurriculars, and it's the same thing that’s driven college me to spend most of my days in Bobst to typing away at my computer."}
{"text": "Yet, in the past, I was always trying to stay busy for the wrong reasons. I wanted to do good at school so I could get into a good college, and go on to have a successful career that made my parents proud. And while most of those goals are still important to me, in the last few months since I’ve been at college I’ve realized that all these goals are much easier to achieve if I am motivated to achieve them. Now, instead of staying busy just for the point of staying busy, I have actual goals I want to work towards, and I enjoy the process of working towards them."}
{"text": "To me, good friends are amongst the most important things in life. They help give you motivation, provide you support during hard times, and are generally necessary given the social nature of human beings."}
{"text": "Although I am very picky with my friends, I have found that having a large social group of people compatible with myself is what’s best for me. It often takes me years to open up to my friends. For example, my friend group in my hometown consists of people I have known for many years now, and they play a crucial role in my life, providing support and companionship anytime I need it."}
{"text": "I think it is because of my pickiness when choosing friends that I find it difficult to be “authentic” with those around me. I am constantly masking my emotions, trying to hide my true thoughts for fear of judgement by my peers. It’s why it took me years to first open up to my friends who I now consider to be as close as family."}
{"text": "This is something I’ve considered to be a hindrance to myself, however. My difficulty to be “authentic” with those around me has instilled me this belief of needing to close myself off, making it difficult for me to form new connections with those around me."}
{"text": "My friends have always been crucial to me. Much like the crutches I used to support myself when I broke my leg, my friends have acted as an emotional crutch for me over the years. When I fall on hard times, I know I can always count on them to support me, and I think that’s why Kate Johnson’s interview resonated so well with me."}
{"text": "In the podcast, Johnson speaks of friendships; real, authentic friends as being a tool that people can use to resist the repressive systems present throughout all of our lives. Much like how I have used my friendships as a tool to resist the negative forces that have impacted me, on a societal level, people can use their friendships as a way to form bonds that are more durable than the oppressive forces that govern their own lives."}
{"text": "I think that meaningful friendships, like the ones that Johnson describes, can be important ways for empowering leaders as, like Johnson describes in the podcast, friendships are an important leg on the journey to becoming more selfless, more generous, and more patient, all important qualities in a leader."}
{"text": "This is something I have noticed firsthand. Through my friendships, I have learned to become a better person. Whether that be going with my friends to go volunteering, or to just act as a source of support for them when they fall on hard times, by finding people I have a connection with, I’ve been able to grow incredibly much as a person."}
{"text": "While many people might think of happiness as something you attain when you achieve all of your goals in life, I think true happiness comes from learning to be content with what you already have. So much of our world is driven by materialistic consumption, and it’s often difficult to just take a step back and really think about what we already have."}
{"text": "It’s also a concept I struggle a lot with. Being content is not something that comes easily to me, or anyone in our modern society, as we’ve been trained to have this instinctive desire to constantly want more from a young age."}
{"text": "Even though I might struggle with this concept, I think that my life does have many of the markings described by Dr. Haidt in The Happiness Hypothesis. For example, my commute everyday to class, and the people I see throughout my day are all conditional factors that have a tremendous impact on my overall happiness level."}
{"text": "Additionally, the friends that I hang out with, the volunteering I do on the weekends, and the hobbies I have are all voluntary activities that play important roles in determining my overall happiness level. I’ve found that I gain tremendous gratification from making progress in the things in my life that I find worth pursuing, whether that be school, or internships, or my extracurriculars."}
{"text": "Overall, I think that my happiness level corresponds well with Dr Haidt’s assessment for determining a person’s overall happiness level."}
{"text": "“The Last Emperor”, a 1987 biopic by Bernardo Bertolucci, is a film covering the life and misfortunes of Puyi, the last emperor of China. It was a movie that I discovered, by chance, as a poster on the wall of a cinema I visited on a field trip in middle school. A striking, unique image, it featured a young boy adorned with a comically large Manchu headgear, standing in front of a seemingly endless crowd of faceless officials all while the enormous gates of the Forbidden City towered over them."}
{"text": "To my adolescent self, the poster had an odd form of hilarity to it. Who was this strange boy? Why were those strange men surrounding him? What led him to wear such a large hat? These were all questions I had, but quickly dropped to fall back in with the rapidity of my plans. Yet, the peculiarity of the poster led the film to stick with me."}
{"text": "Years later, as I was searching for a way to occupy a Saturday night, that poster of The Last Emperor appeared back in my mind. Appearing like an itch that I simply had to scratch, the image I had seen so long ago, combined with a newfound love of history, led me to commit my evening to enjoying the nearly three hour long film. Within just minutes of the opening shot, I had already fallen in love."}
{"text": "What was so special about The Last Emperor to me? When I reflect back on the subject now, I think my fascination with the movie went far deeper than just a poster. It developed from an innate desire within me to see myself, and my culture, portrayed on the big screen. To strip away the sense of mystery that China had always occupied in both my mind and the popular imagination of the western world."}
{"text": "Growing up, the idea of “Oriental Mysticism” always perplexed me. Having been born in China, the idea that Asians were somehow “mysterious” or “enlightened” seemed almost comical to my childhood self. What was so mysterious about me and the land I came from?"}
{"text": "These questions gradually faded away as I got older. There simply wasn’t enough time left in the day to debate the grand differences between Eastern and Western civilization when you had AP classes to manage, extracurriculars to maintain, and friends to hang out with."}
{"text": "Yet, overtime, I also found myself falling into this very trap. There existed two Chinas in my head. The China I had known as a child living in Beijing: the modern, yet tradition filled country that was, for lack of a better word, normal. And the image of China I had developed through the media: the fantastical, despotic China, filled with stories of intrigue, heroism, and adventure. Two contrasting images of the same nation, coexisting simultaneously."}
{"text": "I believe this was the reason that The Last Emperor left such a deep impression on me. It was a movie that was able to combine both of these views I had of my homeland in a way that both confirmed them, yet negated them at the same time."}
{"text": "The movie starts out in a gritty, realistic fashion. In 1950, at a train station on the Chinese Soviet border, 44 year old Puyi is returned to China from the Siberian frontier on board a prisoner of war train. Upon entering the station, he immediately darts for the bathroom and attempts to commit suicide by slitting his wrists, but is heroically saved by guards and fellow prisoners. The grim, dark colors of the scene combined with the brutality of its contents demonstrate the harsh reality that Puyi finds himself in, and the brutalist nature of the set design show off the sense of hopelessness very much present throughout the China of that era."}
{"text": "This is immediately contrasted by the following scene. Taking place in 1908, we follow a fantastical parade of soldiers and courtiers through the streets of Beijing to carry away a young Puyi, then just three years old, from his mother to be taken to the Imperial palace, where he is to be made Emperor following the death of his uncle, the Guanxu Emperor. While most of the scene is shot in the night, the difference in tone is evident through the soundtrack and tone, which both set an atmosphere of tense excitement."}
{"text": "These two scenes set the tone for the rest of the film. The Last Emperor is a film of contrasts, of a combination of fantastical and brutalist elements, simultaneously working together to create an image of China that goes far beyond the typical stereotyping of Western and Eastern filmmakers. Scenes like Puyi’s first and second coronations, mixed with the shelling of the Forbidden City by warlord forces work together to paint an image of a nation that is both still rooted in tradition, but also plagued by the problems of modernity. It’s a country where one’s fantastical imagination can still run wild, yet also remain grounded in reality."}
{"text": "It’s for these reasons that when I finally got to the end of the first of many rewatches of the Last Emperor that Saturday night so long ago, I was so enamored. It was a movie that encapsulated the subconscious ideals I had of a country I felt such a deep connection to, yet had rarely seen since I had left it over a decade ago. These ideals drew me to the film, and by allowing me to express these ideas through film, they also helped to change my very view of the world around me."}
{"text": "Walker Percy’s essay The Loss of the Creature is an essay of questions. Deep, existential questions like: why do we find meaning in the things that we do? How do we perceive the world around us through the lens of society? What can we do to attain a more unbiased, holistic perspective of the experiences we experience? These are all problems that have plagued mankind since the days of Plato and Aristotle, yet, why is it that despite all the strides we have made since those days, we are still no closer to answering them?"}
{"text": "In his essay, Percy does not try to answer these questions, but merely shares with us his viewpoint of them. By giving various rhetorical examples, such as a man from Boston who journeys to the Grand Canyon for a vacation, an American couple road tripping through Mexico, or a high school student in a biology lab, why is it that our expectations never truly match up with reality? How come, when we witness something for the first time, we often feel disappointed, no matter how grand the spectacle is? Through the perspectives of these characters that Percy creates, we are able to experience firsthand some of the fundamental reasons behind why we ask these questions."}
{"text": "The loss of real experiences, as Percy describes it, has been a slow, but steady process. Through our increasing reliance on outside experts, “those who know” (Percy, 3), we have gradually eroded our own ability to experience new things for ourselves. Our traveler, seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time, is “aware that something is wrong. He may simply be bored; or"}
{"text": "he may be conscious of the difficulty: that the great thing yawning at his feet somehow"}
{"text": "eludes him” (Percy, 1). Our couple, after spending hours lost in the Mexican hinterland, stumble upon an Indian village participating in “a corn dance in supplication of the rain god”; “this is ‘it’”, they tell themselves, yet their reaction is merely a mask,  “a rather desperate impersonation”, driven “by their anxiety that it may not prove to be so perfect”, that at any moment a “fellow Iowan might emerge from a ‘dobe hut; the chief might show them his Sears catalog” (Percy, 3). The student, given a Dogfish to dissect, does not truly appreciate the miracle of life that is in front of him. All he sees is “1 specimen of Squalus acanthias”, making the Dogfish become “a rather shabby expression of an ideal reality”, leading to a “radical devaluation of the individual dogfish” (Percy, 5). He sees the creature in front of him not as a sentient individual, but merely as a tool through which he is taught to become “one who knows”."}
{"text": "But what drives us to think this way? Tempting as it may to frame the answer to this problem from a 21st century perspective, Percy, the man behind these observations, wrote them decades before the internet was invented, living in a world where only a few dozen transcontinental phone calls could be made at a time and where many people still corresponded solely through pen and paper. To him, the answer to this lies in the appropriation “by the symbolic complex which has already been formed in the sightseer’s mind” (Percy, 1). It stems from our brain’s inability to think, to experience the world for ourselves, degrading man into waiving “his sovereign rights as a person” and accepting “his role of consumer” as being “the highest estate to which the layman can aspire” (Percy, 6). We are forced into accepting the stifled role of our minds in processing the human condition, and through this we become overly reliant on merely gazing, capturing, but never understanding. These are all issues familiar to us in our hyperconnected world, yet if these same issues were being addressed by Percy so long ago, where does the origin behind them lie? With the invention of the telephone? Mass media? The advent of industrialization?"}
{"text": "In the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, there lies a tomb dedicated to the Egyptian Pharaohs Ramses V & VI, built over three thousand years ago and opened long ago during antiquity. Despite its age, what captures the attention of many people today is not the tomb itself, of which there are many in the region, but rather what is carved into its walls."}
{"text": "Scattered all throughout the tomb are carvings etched into the stone not by the original builders of the tomb, but rather by ancient tourists from around the Mediterranean, most notably Rome and Greece, reminiscing on their travels. When translated, their subjects range from humorous or critical statements, like “I cannot read the hieroglyphs”, to poetic quotes like “I was here” or “I admired” (The Archaeologist, 2022). Much as the modern tourist loses sight of the exoticism of the Grand Canyon, becoming and desperately seeking to rise above complacency through photography or forced exclamations, so too were the architects of civilization yearning fervently for a way of forever preserving their own mediocre experiences by attempting to weave a part of their journeys into the wider tapestry of the tomb."}
{"text": "It goes to show then, that preconceived societal notions of how we should view the world around us have existed for far longer than just recent memory. Despite the fact that Romans preceded the striking of the first steel beams or the running of the first steam engines by two thousand years, they too were slaves to the same societal pressures we commonly associate with industrial and post industrial society. We as humans must have some innate desire to want to generate symbolic complexes, trying to either find value in the absence of it, or underappreciating the magnificent just as it is presented to us. So if such desires to reinforce predicated notions of value are so important to us, are they truly a problem in themselves? Societies and civilizations are built off artificial notions of values, so it must be asked, is Percy justified in questioning the very things that give us our modern way of life? The man from Boston, upon arriving at the Grand Canyon, might be disappointed by what he sees because of preconceived notions of what it should look like, formed through years of exposure to it in the popular imagination. Yet without the avenues through which he has been exposed to these ideas, his modern way of life could not exist. The tourism agency with which he came to the Grand Canyon only exists because society necessitates its existence, as the masses demand access to exotic experiences, however disappointing they might turn out. The money with which he purchases his vacation is earned by working in a job, created by society to give its members redeemable rewards for labor. Our modern way of life is fueled by society, by its expectations and social structures; would we truly be freer if we rid ourselves of these institutions in order to recover our individuality?"}
{"text": "I believe that the origins of Percy’s “dissatisfaction” with societal norms, and his emphasis on the individual over the collective, can be traced back to his life experiences. While born into a relatively prominent Southern family, (with his relatives having held roles in the Confederate government and the US Senate), Percy’s life would be quickly turned upside down when, at the age of just thirteen, his father took his own life in the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. This catastrophic event threw his family into turmoil, leading his mother to join his father just two years later, while Percy was sent to live with a distant cousin in Mississippi."}
{"text": "A tragedy as large as the loss of his parents undoubtedly demonstrated to the young Percy how fragile our lives truly are. Despite all the wealth and power his family held, none of it was enough to prevent the death of his parents, and the ensuing fallout that followed. Our overreliance on society for support, approval, or validation can have disastrous consequences, and when we can no longer rely on those around us, only the individual remains."}
{"text": "As such, it comes as no surprise that isolation plays a big role in Percy’s works. Throughout The Loss of the Creature, Percy utilizes examples where the individual is completely isolated from civilization as a way of demonstrating the power of sovereignty over oneself. In Percy’s mind, for example, the truest way of gaining true experience is through staunch individualism, and we see this all through the essay, like when he states that “The most extreme case of access by privilege … is the Huxleyan novel of the adventures of the surviving remnant after the great wars of the twentieth century. An expedition from Australia lands in Southern California and heads east. They stumble across the Bright Angel Lodge, now fallen into ruins. The trails are grown over, the guard rails fallen away, the dime telescope at Battleship Point rusted. But there is the canyon, exposed at last. Exposed by what? By the decay of those facilities which were designed to help the sightseer” (Percy, 2). To Percy, true experience comes from within, not without, and this perspective was undoubtedly influenced by the individualistic nature he was forced to adopt throughout his early childhood."}
{"text": "Yet, the story of Percy’s early life is still just half the coin. The other half comes about years later, after he had finished his undergraduate degree and was attending medical school at Columbia University. While working as an intern in a sick ward in Bellevue Hospital, Percy contracted tuberculosis, being forced yet again into isolation from society, this time at a retreat in upstate New York in order to recover from the disease. It was here that, as James A. Crank, writer for the newsletter 64 Parishes, puts it, “Percy read a variety of European existential writers, eventually concluding that science could not explain fundamental questions about man’s existence and purpose” (Crank, 2011). Having lived in an age of technocrats and industrialized warfare, these ideas likely influenced Percy’s views on the rest of society, seeing modern civilization as being fundamentally opposed to the spiritual needs of man, and stripping away his individualism. We see this sense of antipathy to modernity all throughout The Loss of the Creature, such as when Percy states “The technician and the sophomore who loves his textbooks are always offended by the genuine research man because the latter is usually a little vague and always humble before the thing; he doesn’t have much use for the equipment or the jargon” (Percy, 5). Through the lens of two, for lack of a better word, unremarkable individuals, Percy conveys to us this idea that at a fundamental level, our world is made up of uncreative, unthinking people seeking only to conform to preapproved ideas of “how things should be”. It’s a contrast that is only highlighted when compared with someone truly remarkable, the “Great Man”, someone who’s not afraid to question societal standards and fundamentally grasp at the real meaning behind an object, not just its superficial value. This point only goes to highlight a later idea brought up by Crank, that “Given Percy’s life-changing sickness, it is perhaps not surprising that many of his characters are sick: either physically ill or afflicted by a mental malaise that isolates them from the ‘normal’ world” (Crank, 2011). In The Loss of the Creature, the sick individual is not any person in particular, isolated from the society, it is society as a whole, sick with the tradeoffs we’ve made in the name of modernity, and isolated from the normal, natural world that was given to us. In our drive for progress, for understanding, Percy believes we have shrunk away from the creaturelike instinct within us to be curious, to experience things for ourselves and not rely on society for guidance and support."}

A Wall Street banker, in the drive for profit, spends countless hours away from home at his desk, hours he could’ve spent with his family, going on vacations, and simply taking in the world around us. Yet, despite all his effort, his life accomplishments can be wiped away in a single moment, as the stock market crashes, and with it, all that he worked so hard for. Throughout his essay Percy wants us to think critically about the price we’ve paid for our modern civilization; for all our advances, are we truly any better off from the “creatures” within us we’ve killed off to be here? The Loss of the Creature is an essay not only questioning the very foundations of human nature, it is also the story of Percy and his family’s firsthand experiences with the high and low points of societal progress. At the end of the day, we are all born, and we will all die, all that remains is what we do in between these two points, and is it truly worth it if we spend the little time we have on this Earth pursuing such seemingly insignificant goals like wealth and power? Doing so, we only lose touch with the fundamental, natural forces that we are composed of."}
