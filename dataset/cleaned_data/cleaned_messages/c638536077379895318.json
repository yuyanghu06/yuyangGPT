This isn’t a broad note that I’m aiming at everyone who sees this, this is a message specifically pointed at YOU. That’s right, YOU, you know who you are, and I’m sick of your shit. We all are.\nThe only good you will ever do for humanity is refusing to participate in it. You can take a vow of silence, you can join a Buddhist monastery, you can even just be a mime! Mimes are fun.\nYou kinda know what I’m saying is true already, don’t you? You understand that you really should shut the fuck up. Then why do you keep speaking then? I’m genuinely curious. Why do you think that you deserve to be heard?\nOh, did you think that this whole rant was directed at me? No, I was just practicing to tell you to shut the fuck up. Oh, that one was good! Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.\nThe core of what I’m getting at is that you’re not a worthwhile person. You’re not worth listening to. Everything you said has been said before, more eloquently, and more coherently. \nAnd it’s not that everything has been said! We still need people to have discourse, and to say new things and discover new things about ourselves and humanity, but you! You will never be one of those people, so shut the fuck up. \nNow, I understand. You want to respond to me, huh? You wanna let me know how you feel? Go on. Leave a message for me. I’ll read every single one.", "Attachments": ""},

Nobody wants to hear it, nobody will ever want to hear it, nobody cares. And the fact that you thought somebody might care is honestly baffling to me.\nI’ve actually polled the entire world. Here’s a composite of faces of everybody who wants you to shut the fuck up. It seems as if this is a composite of every human being on the planet. Interesting. Now for a composite of the faces that want you to keep talking! Interesting, it seems as if nothing is happening.\nHere’s a world map. Now here’s the text, shut the fuck up. Now that’s what you should do.\nNow, you know what, maybe I am being a little too harsh here, I actually do have it on good authority that thanks to my polling data that there is at least one person  that actually wants to hear you speak. It’s a little child, Mozane Beak, and he, oh, he’s dead? Sorry man I guess nobody wants to hear you talk anymore. Shut the fuck up.\nBut I’m not just telling you to shut up, I’m telling you to shut the fuck up, and you need to hear it. This is a public service. I have nothing to gain from this except by telling YOU, exactly what you need to hear.", "Attachments": ""},
{"ID": 703408458447323137, "Timestamp": "2020-04-25 00:54:05", "Contents": "Donald Trump's IQ is extremely high. His towering intelligence has acted as a lighthouse to guide us, the lost souls. His intelligence can be matched by only some great geniuses, such as Albert Einstein, Adam Smith, and Immanuel Kant, though, probably all these figures combined would not reach a similar level of enlightenment that Trump possess. He is just brilliant. When the other people still think, he has already solved all their problems, regardless of the level of difficulty and scientific challenge that is inherent for solving them. Trump has already shown the solutions to all the big problems that were called as \"millennium\" level and a price was promised for their solution. Unfortunately, like always, his genius was misunderstood by the masses, which made him mentally ill. But we can still see his enormous level of knowledge that was not diminished by his mental illness. No matter what you ask, he always has an answer. His tweets are an unlimited source of wisdom for everyone, demonstrating his encyclopedic knowledge of almost any topic on the Earth and the Universe. His knowledge is so deep, that it's difficult to understand for the masses, and that's why it's tragically called as \"false news\". What jerks! They just don't seem to understand we have the greatest genius of the century, or perhaps, of all history among us.", "Attachments": ""},
